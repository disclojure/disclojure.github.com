<ul>
	<li>Leiningen keeps getting better and better:
<ul>
	<li>You can use leiningen to compile projects that use any version of clojure now thanks to @atosborne. 1.0 coming soon. (via @technomancy)</li>
	<li>Updated the #leiningen powershell script (<a href="http://gist.github.com/239210">here</a>,Â via @fyuryu) -- this is necessary if you want to run leiningen on Windows(tm)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Clojure as a first progamming language? (<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=969595">here</a>, via @hrjn_rss) -- join the fray!</li>
	<li>Tim Bray's Eleven theses on Clojure (<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/12/01/Clojure-Theses">here</a>, via @timbray) -- After <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/09/27/Concur-dot-next">all the work</a> he's put in exploring Clojure, here are his conclusions. It looks like he likes Clojure but doesn't quite like Lisp?</li>
	<li>the ability to run unit tests in the #clojure REPL just has #win written all over it (via @markhneedham) -- indeedy!</li>
	<li>Using Clojure STM from JRuby (<a href="http://spin.atomicobject.com/2009/12/01/jrubyconf-and-clojure-stm">here</a>, via @MarioAquino) -- this is about using @technomancy's<a href="http://github.com/technomancy/clojure-gem"> library </a>that provides access to Clojure's STM to JRuby</li>
</ul>
