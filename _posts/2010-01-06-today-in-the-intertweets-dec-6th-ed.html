<ul>
	<li>Swing Temperature Converter in #Clojure (<a href="http://stuartsierra.com/2010/01/06/heating-up-clojure-swing">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- another article in a series on how to write Swing applications in Clojure. This is about building tad more convoluted application, a Temperature Converter, similar to the one from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/learn/">Java Swing tutorials</a>, which needs the creation of an Event Listener class via Clojure's 'proxy'.</li>
	<li>Sources say "don't know when it'll show up on the site, but shouldn't take long" (via @chrishouser) -- This is about the upcoming book titled "The Joy of Clojure" that will be published as MEAP (think 'alpha') sometime soon!</li>
	<li>I finally got my project off the ground at <a href="http://getclojure.org/">http://getclojure.org/</a> â€” #clojure folk, please submit examples if you have a minute (<a href="http://getclojure.org/">here</a>, via @devn) -- This website strives to collect user-friendly examples for all the functions in Clojure core, and requires volunteers <a href="http://github.com/defn/cljex">to provide those examples</a>. May I suggest that something similar is done for Clojure-contrib?</li>
	<li>Prevalent Persistence for Clojure (<a href="http://github.com/SergeyDidenko/Simple-Persistence-for-Clojure">here</a>, via @kicuauan) -- This is a new project that provides a "<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-objprev/">Prevalent System</a>" type of data persistence to Clojure. In this kind of systems the database exists in-memory and all updates and queries are also executed on the in-memory data, but in parallel all changes to in-memory database are also committed to a log file for later recovery. These kinds of databases are supposed to be very fast!</li>
