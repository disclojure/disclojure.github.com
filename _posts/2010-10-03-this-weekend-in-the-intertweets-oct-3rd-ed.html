<ul>
	<li>Clojure Debugging Toolkit: The video (<a href="http://www.vimeo.com/15462015">here</a>, via @georgejahad) -- The video shows the impressive features of George's <a href="http://georgejahad.com/clojure/emacs-cdt.html">CTD</a>.</li>
	<li>Surd - MongoDB/Ring authentication and authorization application (<a href="http://github.com/sethtrain/surd">here</a>, via @sethrain) -- Title says it all :)</li>
	<li>#cufp, @fogus discussing his experiences with Clojure and Scala. (via @deamwampler) -- I hope there's going to be a video of that, or at least the slides... (by the way, <a href="http://cufp.org/">CUFP = Commercial Uses of Functional Programming</a>)
<ul>
	<li>Here are the slides from my #cufp talk. Good luck making heads or tails out of them :p (<a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2010/10/02/naivete-vs-experience/">here</a>, via @fogus) --  Alright, now we need the video.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Fun with Clojure: Turning Cats into Dogs in Hanoi (inaugural blog post) (<a href="http://jkkramer.wordpress.com/2010/08/27/fun-with-clojure%C2%A0turning-cats-into-dogs-in-hanoi/">here</a>, via @jkkramer) -- A post about graph traversal, a new library for this job (<a href="http://github.com/jkk/loom">loom</a>), and cool visualization of the solutions graphs. Check it out, since the outcome is quite impressive: see the solutions graph being created in 3D and in real time and see also the solution path being found.</li>
	<li>vsClojure, a clojure visual studio 2010 extension (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/ec8fe12813e7d24d">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- I am not sure this is the same project that disclojure reported on last week, but project adds support for Clojure in VS2010. The sources for the project can be found <a href="http://github.com/jmis/vsClojure">here</a>. WIP, but some features are already working, like code highlighting, paren matching and the REPL.</li>
</ul>
