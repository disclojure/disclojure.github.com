You can use your browser zoom to make it bigger without seeing it pixelated, since it is based on vector graphics. For me it worked best in Chrome, and it doesn't work in Safari.</li>

NOTE: I am tweaking a little bit how the links in tweets are presented. I am disobeying a little bit the W3C rules in order to make it clearer what the principal link is (the one referenced in the original tweet) versus other links that I add as background info. The full content of the original tweet is now a link. Thanks for the feedback and let me know how you like it!
