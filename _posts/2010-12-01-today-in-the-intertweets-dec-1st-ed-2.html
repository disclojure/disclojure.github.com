	<li>I'm growing a new programming language, Cacao, inspired by Clojure, integrated with Cocoa (<a href="https://github.com/joubertnel/Cacao">here</a>, via @joubertnel) -- Sounds cool, where are the docs?</li>
	<li>Extract Text from a HTML Document in Clojure (<a href="http://www.xcombinator.com/2010/12/01/extract-text-from-a-html-document-in-clojure/">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- Using <a href="http://jericho.htmlparser.net/docs/index.html">Jericho</a></li>
	<li>Test like you mean it! (<a href="http://offtopic.bestinclass.dk/post/2064126468/test-like-you-mean-it">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- The author of ClojureQL embarks in the ever-uplifting task of write integration tests. Since ClojureQL can support many databases, writing integration test for all of them can be quite daunting. This article shows his strategy for coping with the complexity of such integration tests, with the hope that others write backends for ClojureQL and can use the same tests.</li>
