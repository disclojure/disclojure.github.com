<ul>
	<li>#Java SE 7 released! download from: (<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">here</a>, via @carlosqt) -- Well, download it unless you're using a Mac, then you'll have to build it from sources. Oh, and <a href="http://www.lucidimagination.com/blog/2011/07/28/dont-use-java-7-for-anything/">hopefully you don't use any loops in your code</a>.</li>
	<li>Create Hadoop clusters the easy peasy way with Pallet #clojure &lt;-- Deploying hadoop couldn't be made much easier (<a href="http://bit.ly/qZiRog">here</a>, via @disclojure) -- Full disclosure, I wrote the article, I work on pallet and collaborated with pallet-hadoop. Oh, and pallet is a sponsor of this site, I guess, since it is paying bills for me. Feedback welcome!</li>
	<li>Wish you could run ClojureScript inside the browser from the REPL? Now you can (<a href="https://github.com/ibdknox/brepl">here</a>, via @ibdknox) -- Nice! So instead of running your ClojureScript inside Rhino (a JavaScript impl. for the JVM), it runs your code directly in the browser, which means you can update the DOM from the RELP :) Impressive!</li>
