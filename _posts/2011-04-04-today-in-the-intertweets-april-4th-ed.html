	<li>I thought I was going to like Clojure, but I was wrong. I love it! (via @shearic)</li>
	<li>clj3D: The first (serious as a Monkey) #Clojure 3D library (<a href="http://alfredodinapoli.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/clj3d-the-first-serious-as-a-monkey-clojure-3d-library/">here</a>, via @alfredodinapoli) -- This library works at a higher level than <a href="https://github.com/ztellman/penumbra">Penumbra</a>, a library that provides idiomatic OpenGL bindings for clojure, and it lets you easy manipulate 2 and 3D objects in idiomatic clojure. Based on <a href="http://jmonkeyengine.com/">JMonkeyEngine</a> and <a href="http://plasm.net/">PLaSM</a>.</li>
	<li>I got my understanding of elegance in #clojure code. And you? (<a href="http://kotka.de/blog/2011/04/Do_you_value_elegance.html">here</a>, via @kotarak ) -- What you consider elegant code can be a considered an eye sore for someone else. Elegance is hence in the eye of the beholder. This articles goes over the different stylistic ways of writing the same pair of functions. Pick your style and be happy.</li>

This is a rewrite if the clojure solution that instead of using clojure concurrency primitives, is using agents via <a href="http://antoniogarrote.wordpress.com/2010/09/03/jobim-an-actors-library-for-clojure/">Jobim</a>.</li>
