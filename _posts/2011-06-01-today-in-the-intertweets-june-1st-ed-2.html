	<li>JAX Innovation Awards: The Technology-Finalists are: #Akka, #Clojure, #Gradle, #JRebel, #Neo4j --&gt; VOTE NOW (<a href="http://vote.jax-awards.com/">here</a>, via @JAXenterCOM) -- You know what to do...</li>
	<li>Lazy Evaluation Recursive Grammar Combinators for Clojure (<a href="https://github.com/lambder/LERGC">here</a>, via @danielllo) --<a href="http://www.itu.dk/~carsten/courses/f02/handouts/MonadicParserCombinators.pdf"> Monadic parser combinators</a> that is, but implemented in Clojure, and with a different kind of lazyness (the original implementation is done in gopher, a statically typed lazy language).</li>
	<li>Missing dependency? Oh no! (<a href="http://stuartsierra.com/2011/06/01/dependency-management">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- Maven is your friend, except those times when it is not... then it is your enemy. Sometimes Maven can't find a dependency. This article provides tips to beat Maven into submission. (I Love this comment: "Taking a sip of scotch every time you type “mvn” will get you through the day" by Alex Miller. Alex my friend, either your days are very short, or you can take a lot of scotch!)</li>
	<li>Finally! a #clojure toolbox for #hadoop that isn't 100% tied to #ec2 (<a href="https://github.com/pallet/pallet-hadoop/wiki">here</a>, via @jclouds) -- If you are a <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">hadoop</a> user you know how much time this will save you; a new project has been announced that allows you to describe full hadoop clusters as a data structure and then have <a href="https://github.com/pallet/pallet">pallet</a> automatically build them for you, on any cloud provider (thanks to <a href="http://www.jclouds.org/">jclouds</a>). (Disclosure: I am part of this effort) Here's the <a href="https://github.com/pallet/pallet-hadoop">project</a>, and here is an <a href="https://github.com/pallet/pallet-hadoop-example">example project</a>. WIP, feedback appreciated.</li>
