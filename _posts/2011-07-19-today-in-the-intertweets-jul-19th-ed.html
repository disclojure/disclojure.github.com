<ul>
	<li>#Scala comes to .Net (<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/10299">here</a>, via @carlosqt) -- And Microsoft funded the effort, no less! Visual Studio plugin in the works.</li>
	<li>wrote #SOAP library for #Clojure (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/taka2ru/clj-soap">here</a>, via @t2ru) -- Finally somebody took one for the team and delved into the underbelly of software development so that you didn't have to. Not sure why is this a big deal? Consider yourself lucky ...</li>
	<li>Some "one-liners" in Factor (inspired by a Clojure blog post) (<a href="http://re-factor.blogspot.com/2011/07/one-liners.html">here</a>, via @mrjbq7) -- Now if learning Clojure expanded your mind, try with Factor; it's like LSD.</li>
	<li>All entries are in. Here is the "What will Rich Hickey announce tomorrow" poll. Share it and vote away! (<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/RLRWRP7">here</a>, via @disclojure) -- Yeah, and tomorrow I'll be posting the results. Very interesting "Other" entries so far; I like "Clojure in Scala" the best! Please cast your vote soon, and oh, no prizes whatsoever for the winners.</li>
	<li>Common theme talking to Oracle folks at #jvmls: Oracle really cares about multi-language support for Java/JDK/JVM. (via @headius) -- This related to the<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/mlvm/jvmlangsummit/"> JVM Language Summit</a> that is taking place this week. Apparently Oracle is cool with other languages on the JVM (as long as they're PL/SQL?).</li>
