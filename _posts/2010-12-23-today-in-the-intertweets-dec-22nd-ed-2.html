<ul>
	<li>I secretly hope Clojure pods will have a small locking bug, that will lead to a podrace condition. #starwars (via @pepijndevos)</li>
	<li>Now you can use Marginalia via Leiningen to generate your Clojure project docs (big thanks to @napple as always) (<a href="http://fogus.me/fun/marginalia/#leiningen.marg">here</a>, via @fogus) -- <a href="http://fogus.me/fun/marginalia/">Marginalia</a> is a literate programming library for Clojure that was announced yesterday.</li>
	<li>Just had a swank repl spawn an nrepl and then load the ns of the code that spawned the nrepl. Might have just created a black hole (via @objcmdo) -- This must be true, and I must have traveled back in time at least 15 years via this black hole. Otherwise how do I explain that I am coding in Lisp and using Emacs daily?...</li>
	<li>Large websites built with functional programming languages (Scala and Clojure the big winners) (<a href="http://www.quora.com/Functional-Programming/What-are-some-large-websites-built-with-functional-programming-languages">here</a>, via @omargomez) -- This is a question on Quora.</li>
