<ul>
	<li>How we Deploy our Clojure App (<a href="http://asymmetrical-view.com/2010/08/26/how-were-deploying-our-clojure-applications.html">here</a>, via @kyleburton) -- Automatically deploy a clojure webapp using <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home">Chef</a>.</li>
	<li>Reusable method implementations for deftypes (<a href="http://onclojure.com/2010/08/26/reusable-method-implementations-for-deftypes/">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- The new types in clojure 1.2 are very powerful, both in terms of their flexibility and their performance. Deftype allows you to create lean java classes from clojure. Records are deftypes extended to become first-class clojure citizens (e.g. map support, metadata support, etc...) Currently there is no support for reusing method implementations in deftypes (i.e. reuse map support from records.) This article introduces the library <a href="http://code.google.com/p/clj-methods-a-la-carte/">methods-a-la-carte</a> that allows you to do just that.</li>
	<li>Get @chrishouser's top-selling "The Joy of Clojure" for 40% off using code s140 (until Sept 1) (<a href="http://joyofclojure.com/buy">here</a>, via @fogus)</li>
	<li>Used my lunch break to update the Trammel docs with the new syntax (<a href="http://fogus.me/fun/trammel/">here</a>, via @fogus) -- <a href="http://github.com/fogus/trammel">Trammel</a> is a contracts programming library for Clojure that is WIP. Lately the syntax has changed quite a bit and this article introduces this new syntax.</li>
	<li>Follow-up to yesterday's post with some examples on using #zeromq to connect #clojure to #ruby! (<a href="http://blog.trydionel.com/2010/08/26/using-0mq-for-clojure-and-ruby-interop/">here</a>, via @trydionel) -- This is a follow-up to this article showing <a href="http://blog.trydionel.com/2010/08/25/setting-up-0mq-for-clojure-on-osx/">how to connect to zeromq from Clojure</a>, and it shows how to get Clojure and Ruby talking.</li>
