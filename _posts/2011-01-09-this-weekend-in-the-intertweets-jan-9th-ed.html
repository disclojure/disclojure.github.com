<ul>
	<li>I'm broken beyond repair: I wanted to start a blog, but I'm now writing a blog generation library in Clojure (via @paraseba) -- It happens, it happens...</li>
	<li>Interview with @LauJensen: ClojureQL 1.0.0 Beta 'totally different in every regard' (<a href="http://jaxenter.com/interview-clojureql-overhaul-33262.html">here</a>, via @JAXenterCOM) -- Nice! Clojure getting more exposure via @LauJensen and <a href="https://github.com/LauJensen/clojureql">ClojureQL</a>.</li>
	<li>Make Emacs and clojure-mode indent your own macros and forms like `defn` (<a href="https://gist.github.com/769864">here</a>, via @learnclojure) -- That's a neat trick. This way, Emacs will treat your macros as some of the clojure special forms when performing automatic indentation. I have been wanting this for quite long myself :)</li>
	<li>Analysis of the #LessAmbitiousMovies Twitter Meme (<a href="http://nathanmarz.com/blog/analysis-of-the-lessambitiousmovies-twitter-meme.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- So if you're on twitter you might have noticed an annoying (at least to me) meme spreading fast (and dying quite fast too, to my enjoyment) in which people tweeted toned down movie titles. This study, done with Clojure and <a href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog">Cascalog</a>, only took 2 hours to put together and it tracks 25TB in social data. Not bad, not bad.</li>
	<li>Clojure for module development in Google Guice? Weird? (<a href="http://blog.japila.pl/2011/01/clojure-for-module-development-in-google-guice/">here</a>, via @ jaceklaskowski) -- Guice is a dependency-injection framework developed by google. Why you'd want to use that with clojure, I do not know...</li>
	<li>Lisp (including Clojure) is finally an A grade language on the TIOBE index for 2010. 2011 will be even better. (<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">here</a>, via @ghoseb) -- Up and up! .... er, what? Still behind Delphy?!</li>
	<li>How to build a Social Media Site using Enlive/Moustache/ClojureQL (<a href="http://bestinclass.dk/index.clj/2011/01/building-a-social-media-site.html">here</a>, via @LauJensen) -- This is a quite detailed article about building a non-trivial site with the mentioned tools. If you are building or planning on building a website in clojure this is a good place to start reading.</li>
