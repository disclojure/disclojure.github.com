<ul>
	<li>#NetBeans 7.0 RC1 released! (<a href="http://netbeans.org/community/releases/70/">here</a>, via @carlosqt) -- In case you are using it with <a href="http://www.enclojure.org/">enclojure</a>...</li>
	<li>Guess who is officially getting his book published? Ready yourself, world, Meet Clojure is going to blow your door down! (via @IORayne) -- Excellent! Yet another clojure book in the making. We are up to... how many? 7, 8? Congrats Anthony!</li>
	<li>First release of my JSON/SMILE lib based off of clj-json, Cheshire (<a href="https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire">here</a>, via @thnetos) -- From the Github README of the project "clojure-json had really nice features (custom encoders), but was slow; clj-json had almost no features, but was very fast. I wanted the best of both worlds." It also adds features like Date/UUID/Set/Symbol encoding and <a href="http://wiki.fasterxml.com/SmileFormatSpec">SMILE</a> support.</li>
	<li>App provides quick way to compare langs (<a href="http://langref.org/erlang+ruby+haskell+clojure/all">here</a>, via @butaji) -- Some of the clojure entries could use some formatting, especially with the closing parens!</li>
	<li>cloherence, a thin #clojure layer on top of coherence. now adding clojure maps semantics to grid caches. (<a href="https://github.com/paulosuzart/cloherence">here</a>, via @paulosuzart)</li>
</ul>
