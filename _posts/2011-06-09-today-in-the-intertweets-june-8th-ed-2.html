<ul>
	<li>Finished up real selector support in Seesaw tonight. Not half bad I think. (<a href="http://blog.darevay.com/2011/06/a-brief-note-on-seesaw-selectors/">here</a>, via @darevay) -- So this is an interesting use of one of the Enlive concepts, the selector. You can use this selector now not to find elements in an html page, but in a Swing application. How cool is that?!</li>
	<li>Reify a clojure protocol using a function to implement all methods. (<a href="https://gist.github.com/1014477">here</a>, via @ordnungswprog) -- A macro that does what the title says.</li>
