  [Friend](https://github.com/cemerick/friend) is aiming at becoming "a common abstraction for authentication and authorization mechanisms", this ring middleware can be extended to many A&A mechanisms and libraries. The [README](https://github.com/cemerick/friend) for the project is pretty complete, and I am loving this trend of thoroughly documenting your libraries.

  Alex Payne is a [language lover](http://al3x.net/2010/04/05/elc.html), wrote a [book on Scala](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596155964.do) and is now the CTO/cofounder of [Simple](https://www.simple.com/). Now he looks back and revisits his decision to emphasize Scala over Clojure. I'd love to know the reasons...
