Busy Monday! Mmm,... let's see what we've got here ...
<ul>
	<li>Developing Google Wave Robots Outside of Google App Engine with Clojure (<a href="http://wave.thewe.net/2009/10/19/developing-google-wave-robots-outside-of-google-app-engine-with-clojure/">here</a>, via @theWE_) -- Follow their design and you won't have to re-upload your application every time you make a change in clojure.</li>
	<li>Another #clojure book from Mannings "Idiomatic Clojure" by Chris Houser and Michael Fogus (via @wmacgyver) -- that makes it three slated for next year: this one, "Clojure in Action" by Amit Rathore (Manning) and "Definitive Guide to Clojure" by Luke VanderHart (Apress)</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->
<ul>
	<li>The case for #clojure (here, via @stuarthalloway) -- It seems that Stu has the rare ability to say a lot with little words. In this article he introduces the titles for four of his upcoming talks, but the titles are full message in themselves, so I'm posting them here individually since they've also been retweeted individually today (you can also access the slides that he is putting together for those presentations):
<ul>
	<li>"Clojure's sweet spot is any application that has state."</li>
	<li>"Clojure is a better Java than Java."</li>
	<li>"Design Patterns are a disease, and Clojure is the cure."</li>
	<li>"Write functional Clojure and get shit done." -- heh... "Getting Shit Done" is also my wife's version of GTD (Getting Things Done)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Rich Hickey has been busy thinking about new possible features for Clojure. Here are two relevant tweets:
<ul>
	<li>Rich Hickey's proposal for a new protocols feature in Clojure (<a href="http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Protocols">here</a>, via @liebke)</li>
	<li>Clojure Datatypes (<a href="http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Datatypes">here</a>, via @fogus)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>From Java to Clojure (<a href="http://pnehm.citerus.se/kunskap/pnehm/pnehmartiklar/fromjavatoclojure.5.1fe8f33123572b59ab800023092.html">here</a>, via @weakreference) -- "Patrik Fredriksson takes us on a tour from Java to Clojure, by using a step by step conversion from one language to the other. If you're a Java programmer who wants to know a little bit about Clojure, make sure you come along."</li>
</ul>
