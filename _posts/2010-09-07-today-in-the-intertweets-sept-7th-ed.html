<ul>
	<li>Made a #Clojure interface for the Google Ai Challenge—have yet to test it, but it's up (<a href="http://ai-contest.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=411">here</a>, via @ihodes) -- Ready to write your bot to compete in <a href="http://ai-contest.com/">Google's AI Challenge</a>? It's Planet Wars!
<ul>
	<li>You can now participate (well, once it's set up server-side, too) in the Planet-Wars Google AI contest with #Clojure (<a href="http://github.com/ihodes/ai-contest-planet-wars-clj">here</a>, via @ihodes)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Want to learn idiomatic #clojure? Tie one hand behind your back: no recur, no lazy-seq. (or attend next #conjlabs <a href="http://conj-labs.eu/">http://conj-labs.eu/</a> ;-)) (via @cgrand) -- Hey, did you know that you can write the word 'database' with just your left hand? Which hand will you guys tie on the back of your students during the training sessions? Seriously, if you are in Europe during Oct 26th to 28th and want to  learn from the pros, you should consider <a href="http://conj-labs.eu/">conj-labs</a>.</li>
	<li>Been working on a design for a new hosted/remote Clojure REPL impl. Input very welcome. Implementation is on this week. (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1dnb1ONTpK9ttO5W4thxiXkU5Ki89gK62anRqKEK4YZI&amp;authkey=CMuszuMI&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1#">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- This is a proposal to unify remote access to the Clojure REPL, since currently each IDE uses its own proprietary methods. This document proposes a set of requirements for this unified access, and it is awaiting <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1dnb1ONTpK9ttO5W4thxiXkU5Ki89gK62anRqKEK4YZI&amp;authkey=CMuszuMI&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1#">your feedback</a>!</li>
	<li>Web recipes in #clojure by @abedra (<a href="http://github.com/abedra/clojure-web">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- "This is a collection of clojure projects focused on making some sense out of web development on clojure." Tools for this trade? <a href="http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring">Ring</a> + <a href="http://github.com/weavejester/compojure">Compojure</a> + <a href="http://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">Hiccup</a> + <a href="http://github.com/brentonashworth/sandbar">Sandbar</a>.</li>
	<li>Know any Clojure users in Charleston, SC? I'm organizing an inaugural meetup #clojure (via @smashthepast) -- I hope this shootout helps!</li>
	<li>Released Leiningen 1.3.1 while in line to see Gibson. Seems fitting. Will send an announcement to the Clojure list once the event's over. (via @technomancy) -- It does seem fitting.</li>
</ul>
