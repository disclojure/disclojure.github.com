<ul>
	<li>Clojure/core working hard today to get some finishing touches on Rich's "something new" (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Clojure-NYC/">here</a>, via @redinger) -- Yeah, right, you keep teasing us... wait, what?!?! 300 attendees?!</li>
	<li>Goog@le+ #Clojure circle (Post by Claudia Doppioslash) (<a href="https://plus.google.com/102547044539623029950/posts/e1jafgeu1q5">here</a>, via @kumarshantanu) -- Â Check in there to find other Clojurians on G+</li>
	<li>Blogged how to extract child elements in an XML doc using #clojure zip-filter (<a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2011/07/16/clojure-extracting-child-elements-from-an-xml-document-with-zip-filter/">here</a>, via @markhneedham) -- This is an interesting post that describes as seeming simple problem with reading an XML document via zippers. The proposed solution is a good example of proper functional programming.</li>
	<li>Here's UPNP port forwarding in #Clojure (<a href="https://github.com/rosejn/Peer/blob/master/src/peer/address.clj">here</a>, via @rosenj) -- Which brings us to <a href="https://github.com/rosejn/Peer">Peer</a>, a peer to peer networking toolkit for Clojure.</li>
	<li>Wrote a post on writing a simple query DSL for #mongodb in #clojure (<a href="http://christophermaier.name/2011/07/17/creating-a-query-dsl-using-clojure-and-mongodb.html">here</a>, via @_cwm_) -- MongoDB is a NoSQL database that prides itself for being very fast. It has a hashmap-based query language, and this article provides a DSL for building complex queries with ease.</li>
	<li>I just published a #clojure.test runner (<a href="https://github.com/paraseba/test-this">here</a>, via @paraseba) -- Runs your clojure.test tests without change, adds fine grained selection of tests to run, automatically reloads modified files, extensible, and a bit more. Makes testing at the REPL quite more convenient.</li>
</ul>
