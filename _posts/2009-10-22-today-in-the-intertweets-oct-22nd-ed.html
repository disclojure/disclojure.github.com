<ul>
	<li>Uh oh, somebody woke up the Lispers and told them about Clojure... we're in trouble (<a href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=42">here</a>, via @cbeust) -- yes, and somebody woke up this zombie rant; I'm looking at you, Cedric. This is a rant by the developer behind <a href="http://code.google.com/p/loper/">Loper OS</a> (an OS built on Lisp) and in this blog post he/she shares with The World his hatred for Clojure for being impure and other many offenses. This blog post is from last June, which is ancient in Internet years, but nonetheless a few dozen of people re-tweeted about it today. Zombie post indeed!
<ul>
	<li>As a side note, and as @marcusf points out, you should schedule some time and read the article <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">"The Raise of Worse is Better"</a> that is linked to the Loper OS post, and make your conclusions of whether the author <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_P._Gabriel">Richard P. Gabriel</a> was right or not in his assertions, now that more than a decade has passed since it was written.</li>

	<li>Another (very old) Clojure tutorial for non-lispers (<a href="http://www.moxleystratton.com/article/clojure/for-non-lisp-programmers">here</a>, via @onion_papa)</li>
	<li>If you are a Spanish speaker, here are a couple of clojure blogs for you (<a href="http://javierneirasanchez.blogspot.com/">here</a>, via @ajlopez and <a href="http://antoniogarrote.lacoctelera.net/tags/clojure">here</a>, via @jneira) -- oh, and now there is a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure-hispano">spanish clojure mailing list</a> too (still empty though!)</li>
	<li>Tomorrow at <a href="http://thestrangeloop.com/">Strange Loop</a> I will be demonstrating some new capabilities of the Grails Clojure plugin (<a href="http://thestrangeloop.com/sessions/polyglot-web-development-grails">here</a>, via @jeffscottbrown)  -- I wish I was there!</li>
	<li>If you use agents inside Clojure, be sure to call (shutdown-agents) if you want your tests to actually finish (via @hlship) -- a good piece of advice</li>
	<li>Concurrency Patterns: Java, Scala, and Clojure (<a href="http://fupeg.blogspot.com/2009/10/concurrency-patterns-java-scala-and.html">here</a>, via @michaelg) -- in this article the author provides his opinion on Java, Scala and Clojure  compare in terms of concurrency on four different scales: 1) how easy is to write concurrent code, 2) How efficient the code is, 3) How fast the code is and 4) how reusable the code is.</li>
	<li>Another oldie but goodie from Amit Rathore: Clojure, the REPL and test-driven development (<a href="http://www.diigo.com/annotated/94b5419ff0856e71f9b3bbddafa8daf9">here</a>, via @jneira) -- Amit is the author of the forthcoming book "Clojure in Action" from Manning</li>
