<ul>
	<li>Fun, possibly useful to someone: #clojure #repl #hack (<a href="https://github.com/wirde/swank-inject">here</a>, via @jwirde) -- This project lets you inject a swank server into any running java app, as long as the app is running with debugging enabled. Pretty scary, no? And cool.</li>
	<li>Clojure: State Management (<a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2011/04/clojure-state-management.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @yueliufeeds) -- This article is directed to people that would be interested in learning what is the deal with clojure and state that everybody is talking about. It doesn't assume knowledge of clojure so it is good material to send around to get your colleagues interested in Clojure.</li>
	<li>Clojure is not for solving complicated problems. There are no complicated problems in Clojure (via @clojure_mexico) -- I like the cut of your jib!</li>
