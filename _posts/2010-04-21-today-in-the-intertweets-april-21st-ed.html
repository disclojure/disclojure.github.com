	<li>Clojure section on my site and two new articles (<a href="http://alexott.blogspot.com/2010/04/clojure-section-on-my-site-and-two-new.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">here</a>, via @alexott_en) -- The new two articles are <a href="http://alexott.net/en/clojure/ClojureMaven.html">Building Clojure code with Maven</a> and <a href="http://alexott.net/en/clojure/ClojureLein.html">Using Leiningen to maintain projects written in Clojure</a>.</li>
	<li>Interesting discussion about what OO means on #clojure irc (<a href="http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2010-04-21.html#i28">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- I can't really summarize all the knowledge and wisdom thrown around in this chat about OO. The discussion is indeed very interesting if you're into that sort of thing (and you are, because you're reading this site).</li>
	<li>Free Clojure course starts off tomorrow (<a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/03/09/clojure-101-a-new-course/">here</a>, via @IndianGuru) -- This course is wildly popular; more than 400 attendees so far!</li>
	<li>Clojure &amp; Scala Similarities - Twins separated at birth? Here are my thoughts (<a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2010/04/clojure-scala-similarities-twins-separated-at-birth/">here</a>, via @LauJensen) -- This is in response to <a href="http://codemonkeyism.com/scala-vsclojure-part-3-similarities/">this other blog post from yesterday</a>. The OP says Scala and Clojure are very similar. Lau in response says that they are very different.
<ul>
	<li>mmm it's curious scala devs stressing similarities between scala and clojure and clojure devs highlighting the diffs. Clojure is more sexy (via @jneira) -- You might be onto something my friend!</li>
