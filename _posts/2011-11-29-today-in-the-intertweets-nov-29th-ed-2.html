<ul>
	<li><a href="http://yfrog.com/z/ocsykp">Relative growth: functional languages are growing more than anything! #FP is the future </a>(via @diego_pacheco) -- We've seen this graph before. Clojure keeps going strong in adoption (job openings), so are Scala and Erlang.</li>
	<li><a href="http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/LOGIC-21">Pattern matching in #clojure core.logic no longer needs ? prefix to introduce variables. Even more declarative, sweet!</a> (via @ambrosebs) -- It looks like all the variables named ?something won't be needed anymore in core.logic.</li>
	<li><a href="http://martinsprogrammingblog.blogspot.com/">Just blogged "Scheme as an embedded DSL in Clojure" at http://martinsprogrammingblog.blogspot.com/</a> (via @ martintrojer) -- Just in case you came to Clojure from Scheme, now you can get both, together.</li>
	<li><a href="http://clojure.com/blog/2011/11/29/avout.html">[ANN] Avout: Distributed State in Clojure</a> (via @liebke) -- Distributed STM, in clojure, with distributed versions of Atom and Ref. Asynchronous communication across systems clojure-style.</li>
	<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/1406238">Yammer moving off of Scala... maybe an opportunity for some #clojure? </a>(via @mi_camp) -- This was an email that was supposed to be private but that somehow got leaked, in which one of the engineers at Yammer explains to both the CEO of TypeSafe, and Martin Odersky the creator of Scala, the reasons why Yammer is back to Java after years of using Scala. A good exercise is to carefully read this email, understand the pains the engineer is referring to, and then think about where Clojure is inflicting similar pains. And no, it doesn't look like they're moving to Clojure either.</li>
