<ul>
	<li>Here is my TechTalk from today's Google Developer Day 2010: HTML5 and Clojure on GAE (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/smartrevolution/writing-html5-apps-with-google-app-engine-google-closure-library-and-clojure">here</a>, via @smartrevolution) -- Clojure and <a href="http://code.google.com/closure/">Closure</a> in the same presentation, this must be a first! Glad to see Google showcasing <a href="https://the-deadline.appspot.com/login">The Deadline</a> and clojure.</li>
	<li>Received the foreword for The Joy of Clojure. Consider my world. It's rocked. (via @fogus) -- So who is the mysterious author? Tell us!!</li>
	<li>I have before me a contract for a Ring book from the Pragmatic Press. (via @marick) -- Clojure will have a book on web development :)</li>
	<li>Announcing Clothesline, a Clojure port of WebMachine. Part of my work for BankSimple. Check out the code (<a href="https://github.com/BankSimple/Clothesline">here</a>, via @KirinDave) -- <a href="http://webmachine.basho.com/">Webmachine</a> is a different kind of web framework for Erlang, with nice functional properties (e.g. referential transparency, or functions instead of methods). Currently clothesline is a naive but functional port of webmachine to clojure, with an eye to support many other JVM-based languages.</li>
