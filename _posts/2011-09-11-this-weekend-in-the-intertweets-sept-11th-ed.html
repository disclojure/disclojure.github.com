<ul>
	<li>"<a href="http://fronx.posterous.com/how-to-learn-clojure-effectively">How to learn Clojure effectively</a>" (my short talk at @cljugb converted into text) (via @fronx) -- This advice comes from someone that came to Clojure from Ruby, and offers a sensitive learning path.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/The-REPL-and-Evaluation-Environments">#ClojureScript has a new REPL</a>. Use Rhino or the browser for evaluation. Or bring your own E and write a new evaluator. (via @brentonashworth) -- Well, it looks like the new cljs REPL is here (or at least, committed to the cljs repo). The linked documentation provides examples of how it can be used.</li>
	<li><a href="http://codethat.wordpress.com/2011/09/10/writing-tetris-in-clojure/">Writing Tetris in Clojure</a> (via @unlog1c) -- A step-by-step guide for writing a Swing version of Tetris in Clojure.</li>
	<li>Nice. <a href="https://github.com/robblackwell/AzureRunMe#readme">Azure Launch Pad</a> making it easy to run java/c/c++/clojure/lisp/delphi/ruby on rails in azure (via @thiago_bagua) -- At first I thought this was referring to those massive-parallel JVM chips, but it turns out his refers to Microsoft's Cloud. <a href="http://www.azulsystems.com/">Azul</a> != <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/">Azure</a>, go figure!, but interesting nonetheless.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/technomancy/clojure-mode/pull/41">#emacs support for running a #ClojureScript REPL against the browser? Yes, please.</a> (via @rubbish) -- Looks like swank-clojure is about to get proper cljs REPL support. Woo hoo!</li>
