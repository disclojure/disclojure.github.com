<ul>
	<li>New blog post on the #clojure cycle function (<a href="http://twitter.com/objcmdo/status/20970953613">here</a>, via @objcmdo) -- This is a good article to learn about the power of lazy sequences.</li>
	<li>Clojure 1.2 RC3 is out. (<a href="http://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/1.2.x/changes.txt">here</a>, via @stuarthalloway) -- That was fast! Only some fixes, no new features.</li>
	<li>Just noticed joy of clojure is Manning's best selling MEAP currently, awesome work @fogus &amp; @chrishouser (via @westernwizard) -- Kudos!</li>
	<li>Micro languages in Clojure via macros and let. (<a href="http://will.groppe.us/post/943063292/micro-languages-in-clojure-via-macros-and-let">here</a>, via @wilig) -- This article walks the reader through the process of creating a micro-language for interacting with SQL databases with the power of macros and the 'let' statement. A must read IMHO; it is very approachable, informative and let's face it, everybody needs to write a micro-language in their lifetime.</li>
	<li>Follow up to yesterdays article on #clojure protocols. Discuss how to have a default implementation. (<a href="http://fulldisclojure.blogspot.com/2010/08/partially-implemented-protocols.html">here</a>, via @fulldisclojure) -- A method to provide a default implementation for some or all members in of a protocol.</li>
	<li>a strategy game developed using #clojure (<a href="http://mikera.net/ironclad/">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- There are also <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/ff18795390b5960b">some notes from the author</a> about his experience writing games in Clojure; overall he is happy with the level of concurrency, being able to work at a high level and interact with Java, but would love to see primitive support (coming), being able to reduce memory allocations, and maybe a two-phase compilation to deal better with circular references.</li>
	<li>New REPL step debugger for #clojure (<a href="http://lambdebug.github.com/">here</a>, via @puredanger) -- <a href="http://lambdebug.github.com/">Lambdebug</a> is an interesting project that aims at providing a debugger for clojure. Very promising, but it's WIP and lacks key feautres (like support for loop/recur).</li>
	<li>Awesome new #clojure tool (<a href="http://github.com/purcell/ac-slime">here</a>, via @heinz_gies) -- And this tool is an auto-completion library for Emacs, that also shows the documentation along with the currently selected completion option.</li>
	<li>@brweber2 La Clojure plugin for IntelliJ IDEA is now under reworking on Clojure, so it's gonna take a while (via @ilyasergey) -- :(, but if this means that Â the new plugin will be better since it will be coded in Clojure, then :)</li>
	<li>#clojure .net clr mostly up to 1.2RC3 now. (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/2d40edccb55e3b30">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- That'll come handy should Oracle decide to bury the JVM inside their database (joking).</li>
	<li>The hardest part about #clojure is coming up with names for all the beautiful abstractions you magically end up with. (via @_pmh_) -- And this is the tweet of the week.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.gettingclojure.com">www.gettingclojure.com</a>, a wiki for Clojure beginners -- This comes straight form the mailing list. This site has a wiki and forums, devoted to provide guidance and support for clojure newcomers.</li>
</ul>
