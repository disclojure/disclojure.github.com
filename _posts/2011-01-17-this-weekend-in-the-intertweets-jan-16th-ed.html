<ul>
	<li>Dynamically redefining classpath in Clojure REPL (<a href="http://blog.japila.pl/2011/01/dynamically-redefining-classpath-in-clojure-repl/">here</a>, via @jaceklaskowski) -- Ooooh! I didn't know you could do that! Can we get this into Lein/Cake/mvn? or is it already there? Basically you can dynamically add new .jar files into your classpath and use them right away.</li>
	<li>First cut of align-cljlet. Let statement alignment for clojure &amp; emacs. (<a href="https://github.com/gstamp/align-cljlet">here</a>, via @gstamp) -- Pretty code is pretty.</li>
	<li>It's getting better and better (<a href="http://daly.axiom-developer.org/clojure.pdf">here</a>, via @vilsonvieira) -- The latest PDF of "Clojure in Small Pieces" has a lot of content in it. (Warning, that's one BIG file)</li>
	<li>Wrote up some thoughts about different concurrency frameworks (<a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/2011/01/14/comparing-concurrent-frameworks/">here</a>, via @puredanger) -- This is a good survey of the options that you have when dealing with highly concurrent systems. Worth a read, as when the level of concurrency is high enough, some solutions are better than others.</li>
	<li>fs - File system utilities for Clojure: fs - file system utilities Clojure is out (and created a small debate :) (<a href="http://clojurewise.blogspot.com/2011/01/fs-file-system-utilities-for-clojure.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">here</a>, via @tebeka) -- A library for manipulating files and the file system from clojure at a similar level as you would to at the shell.</li>
