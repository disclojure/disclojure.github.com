<ul>
	<li>Strange Loop Talk â€“ Triplestore Testing (<a href="http://www.objectcommando.com/blog/2010/10/15/454/">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- Cool, the Clojure talks at Strange Loop start trickling in. This one is about testing the performance of queries to a tiplestore using the cloud, with clojure and incanter and other cool tools.</li>
	<li>@unclebobmartin's "Failure of State" presentation makes me want to run home and read my "Programming Clojure" book right now. (via @adomokos) -- Uncle Bob is a relentless promoter of Clojure :)</li>
	<li>Guy Steele recommended Clojure for programmers who want to broaden their horizons. #strangeloop (via @benatkin) -- He probably said the same about Fortress, his new language, but this is good enough!</li>
	<li>Schedule posted for #clojureconj. Pls ignore wonky CSS (<a href="http://clojure-conj.org/schedule">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- The wonky CSS is wonky no more, by the way...</li>
	<li>Started working on a leiningen plug-in to make SOAPing from Clojure easier (<a href="http://github.com/jaley/lein-axis">here</a>, via @jamesaley)</li>
	<li>My expression problem talk: "I liked two things about this" Review (<a href="http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/blog/archives/monthly/2010-10.html#e2010-10-14T23_17_23.htm">here</a>, via @chrishouser) -- The slides are <a href="http://strangeloop2010.com/talk/presentation_file/14491/Houser-ClojureExpressionProblem.pdf">here</a>. A bunch of tweeters highlighted this talk as one of the most enlightening of Strange Loop. The slides are really good enough so that you can follow them without a speaker.</li>
	<li>Getting to know Clojure, Leiningen and Lazytest (<a href="http://blog.darevay.com/2010/10/remedial-clojure-leiningen-lazytest-and-some-code/">here</a>, via @davevay) -- This article is narrates first foray info clojure of its authors, using a simple example and a good set of tools for it, leiningen and <a href="http://github.com/stuartsierra/lazytest">Lazytest</a>. It explains how each piece works in making development as painless as possible. It is an interesting read if you're interested in Lazytest too.</li>
	<li>Erlang generic servers and supervisors in clojure (<a href="http://antoniogarrote.wordpress.com/2010/10/17/generic-servers-and-supervisors-in-jobim-clojures-actors-library/">here</a>, via @jneira) -- Erlang gerneric servers and supervisors concepts ported to Clojure via <a href="http://github.com/antoniogarrote/jobim">Jobim</a>. These two concepts form Erlang help you build reliable distributed systems. This article explain how they are implemented in Clojure via Jobim.</li>
