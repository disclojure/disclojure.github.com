<ul>
	<li>Nothing but praise for the #clojure room on Freenode. Props to the #clojure community. (via @basilshkara) -- Indeed.</li>
	<li>The #Devoxx 2009 #Clojure talk by Howard Lewis Ship is now available for free (<a href="http://parleys.com/d/1518">here</a>, via @Stephan007) -- A very good and extensive introduction to Clojure. If your friends or coworkers want to know what's the fuzz about Clojure, send them this video.</li>
	<li>OSGi with Groovy, Clojure, and Scala (<a href="http://lambdalounge.blip.tv/file/3203980/">here</a>, via @c_z) -- A video of the recent presentation from <a href="http://www.mattstine.com/">Matt Stine</a> at the <a href="http://lambdalounge.org/">Lambda Lounge</a> in St. Louis. The presentation is about using different languages in a OSGi environment. One of them is, of course, Clojure.</li>
	<li>In response to "Why I love everything you hate about Java" (<a href="http://romanroe.blogspot.com/2010/02/why-i-hate-everything-you-love-about.html">here</a>, via @romanroe) -- Yesterday we mentioned <a href="http://magicscalingsprinkles.wordpress.com/2010/02/08/why-i-love-everything-you-hate-about-java/">this article</a> about the perils of using high-level languages in a high-performance production environment. This article by Roman Roelofsen is a somewhat of a rebuttal to the cited article, but not of the need of the techniques mentioned in the original article; it is a rebuttal of the need of the Java/OOP boilerplate that the original author claims is inevitable. To prove the point, Roman provides a detailed step-by-step walk-through to building the same structures in the original article, but in Clojure. By using 'binding' it provides a nice way of performing convention-over-configuration. And by just using the functional aspects of Clojure provides code that is easily 'decorable. A very entertaining and educational read!</li>
	<li>By the way, #clojure contrib.json has a pretty-printer now (<a href="http://github.com/richhickey/clojure-contrib/commit/319057dbf324b5c10577c25bfe9e0179692684f5">here</a>, via @stuartsierra)</li>
	<li>New #katacast, String Calculator in Clojure by @t_crayford! (<a href="http://katas.softwarecraftsmanship.org/?p=154">here</a>, via @Katakasts) -- Ok. This is pretty fascinating (to me, at least). A <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/code_kata_backg.html#more">Code Kata</a> is a small exercise/problem to solve. A <a href="http://katas.softwarecraftsmanship.org/?page_id=2">Katacast</a> is a screencast of the solving of a Code Kata -- but no voice-over, just classical music! Anyway, @t_crayford presents this Katakast in which he solves the <a href="http://katas.softwarecraftsmanship.org/?p=80">String Calculator Kata</a> in Clojure using TDD as a development method. Watching this video is fascinating although you probably won't be able to see the code given the resolution of the video, but you will surely be able to see choreography between the two Emacs pages; the test and the code. EDIT: You can download the video from Vimeo and then you'll be able to read the code</li>
	<li>My sides for next week's #cap_clug: "Data Sorcery with #Clojure &amp; #Incanter: Introduction to Datasets &amp; Charts" (<a href="http://data-sorcery.org/2010/02/11/data-sorcery-pt1/">here</a>, via @liebke)</li>
	<li>"first cut of generic vector implementation, supporting vectors of primitives" #clojure in master branch (<a href="http://github.com/richhickey/clojure/commit/61202d2ff6925002400a9843e8fbd080f3bef3a5">here</a>, via @chrishouser) -- Go take a look at that code :)</li>
	<li>Parsing in Clojure via a Backtracking State Monad (<a href="http://brehaut.net/blog/2010/ghosts_in_the_machine">here</a>, via @hkrnws) -- This is the second article of a series by Andrew Brehaut about monads in Clojure. We mentioned the <a href="http://brehaut.net/blog/2010/welcome_to_the_machine">first article</a> in the series yesterday. This one is about using backtracking monads to create combinatorial parsers. If you are new to monads, get a couple of Advils... you'll need them!</li>
