<ul>
	<li>Clojure and <a href="http://fragmental.tw/2011/08/14/clojure_maps_are_not_the_answer.html">Map abuse</a> (via @pcalcado) -- Although using maps as abstractions provides a lot of flexibility, it comes with its own set of perils.</li>
	<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/678867/how-to-defn-a-function-from-string-in-clojure">How to defn a function from string in Clojure</a>? - Stack Overflow (via @Sunng) -- Just check out the many ways to skin this cat, and then think about for how many languages the answer would be "You can't".</li>
	<li>Revelytix <a href="http://revelytix.com/content/revelytix-release-rex-and-spinner-early-access">releases</a> Rex (rules) and Spinner (federation) semantic web products. (shh: all written in Clojure) (via @puredanger) -- "Together Spinner and Rex enable a paradigm shift in enterprise information management. Combining enterprise knowledge with enterprise data will make any enterprise better than it is today." It's good to see commercial products built on Clojure too.</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.dhananjaynene.com/2011/08/cperformance-comparison-languages-styles-and-vms-java-scala-python-erlang-clojure-ruby-groovy-javascript/">Performance</a>: Languages, styles &amp; VMs. Java, Scala, Python, Erlang, Clojure, Ruby, Groovy, JavascriptÂ (via @dnene) -- This is definitely not in my list of things to do before I die: compare the performance of two languages. This is only for the brave (o the crazy, or are those words synonym?) This post has already <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/swannodette/status/103135810991308800">been</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/missingfaktor/status/103156309226037249">somewhat</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/swannodette/status/103177444059656192">contested</a>, and the clojure numbers in the article have been updated significantly (spoiler: clojure is very slow compared to Java and Scala)</li>
	<li>Yesterday I stumbled across this clojure mailing list thread about libraries. Seems like a<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/affb08d66c048c7f/bee323e78d1ba3d3?lnk=gst&amp;q=clojure+libraries#bee323e78d1ba3d3"> simpler time long ago</a> :) (via @darevay) -- Ah! Those were the times... wait, this is only 2.5 years old!</li>
