  Introducing Light Table - a new IDE
 author: ibdknox
 url: http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/04/12/light-table---a-new-ide-concept/
 comment: >
  If ClojureScript needed a killer app, this is it. Built in [6
  days](https://twitter.com/#!/ibdknox/status/190857331238645760),
  6. Chris Granger is no stranger to building IDEs (program manager
  for Visual Studio, or somethign like that) and has always expressed
  interest in building a better IDE. In this post Chris shows his early prototype that
  has caused many jaws to drop around the interwebs, people to drool,
  and many to say "please,
  take my money". Light Table will initially support [ClojureScript and
  JavaScript](https://twitter.com/#!/ibdknox/status/191236200768610305),
  runs inside the browser, and does everythign it can to make you very
  productive by allowing you to focus on the function at hand and it's
  related functions, their 
  documentation, and even explain to you how your code will run as you
  type. If you haven't watched the video yet, beware and protect your
  jaw, and then proceed to learn about its [immediate
  future](http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/04/15/light-tables-numbers/)
