	<li>A circuit breaker in Clojure (<a href="http://blog.higher-order.net/2009/11/23/clojure-circuit-breaker/">here</a>, via @Raymondz5ly) -- Using <em>deftype</em> and <em>defprotocol</em>! A circuit breaker is a mechanism designed to stop one system from attempting to contact another system if failure is detected, in order to prevent overloading such failing system and also to prevent the calling system to wait indefinitely. You can find a good write-up on this mechanism in the book <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mnee/release-it">"Release It!"</a> page 104. This article explores how to write such mechanism in Clojure</li>
	<li>A couple of Clojure agent examples (<a href="http://lethain.com/entry/2009/nov/22/a-couple-of-clojure-agent-examples/">here</a>, via @jlugocp) -- This article comes form someone fluent in Erlang. It exposes a few uses of agents to sequence access to shared data structure (that's what they are for anyway). The examples are: Sequencing the writes to a log file, Parallel HTTP fetches and Using agents as a Message Relay (interesting this last one!)</li>
	<li>And oh! Please help the Clojure developers prepare for 1.1 by answering this short <a href="http://bit.ly/8Uuhlb">usage survey</a> (via @stuartsierra)</li>
