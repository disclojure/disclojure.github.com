During disclojure's prologued absence from the intertweets the Conj organizers also put together some detailed reviews of how it went: <a href="http://clojure.com/blog/2011/11/17/second-conj.html">(second conj)</a> and <a href="http://clojure.com/blog/2011/11/22/unconj.html">UnConj</a>.</li>

It is hard to summarize this post, and it says nice things about the Clojure community, so go and read it presto!</li>
