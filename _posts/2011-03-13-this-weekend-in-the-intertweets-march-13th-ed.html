<ul>
	<li>Slides from my presentation last night about Cascalog, ElephantDB, and Storm (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/nathanmarz/clojure-at-backtype">here</a>, via @nathanmarz) -- I had the pleasure to assist to the meet-up in which these were used. <a href="http://www.backtype.com/">Backtype</a> is a Clojure powerhouse and they're putting a lot of great open source projects out. These slides cover them all.</li>
	<li>clojure 1.3 alpha 6 (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/4308d846bf2ef129">here</a>, via @stuarthalloway) -- One of the new features/bugfixes is "detect and report cyclic load dependencies (CLJ-8)". Looks like a rather old ticket!</li>
	<li>Announcement: clj-decline - validation sucks (<a href="http://joost.zeekat.nl/2011/03/12/announcement-clj-decline-validation-sucks/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- Why another validation library? you say. Read the rant^H^H^H^Hpost in which the rationale is laid out.</li>
	<li>Announcement: ring-persistent-cookies (<a href="http://joost.zeekat.nl/2011/03/12/announcement-ring-persistent-cookies/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @planetclojure)  -- There is no cookie in my house that persists. I don't think this will help with those either...</li>
	<li>(converge [{:group-name "10cheapies" :image {:spot-price (float 0.03)} :count 10}] :compute ec2) (via @jclouds) -- <a href="https://github.com/pallet/pallet">Pallet</a> just got support for spot instances in Amazon Web Services' EC2. Cloud computing on the cheap!</li>
	<li>My Clojure impl of generalized quantifiers for English: just playing with a compositional model-theory #semantics. (<a href="https://github.com/jimtyhurst/generalized-quantifiers">here</a>, via @jimtyhurst) -- This will let your code understand sentences like "less than 5 dogs barked" and validate if the sentence is true when matched to the model.</li>
</ul>
