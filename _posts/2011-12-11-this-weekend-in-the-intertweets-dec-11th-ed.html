<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.knowledgebooks.com/">Converted Common Lisp and Java code for my SAAS to 100% Clojure. Some info:</a> (via @mark_l_watson) -- Known author <a href="http://markwatson.com/">Mark Watson</a> decided to ditch a Common Lisp + Java implementation of a NLP+AI+SemWeb service and rewrite it instead in Clojure. I here encourage (demand?) the author to blog about the experience.</li>
	<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ring-clojure/browse_thread/thread/f18338ffda7e38f5?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Ring 1.0.0 Released </a>(via @planetclojure) -- This is bigger than when GMail went out of beta. Congrats Mark and James!</li>
	<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/1452640">A Leiningen dependency-tree "hello world"</a> (via @cemerick) -- A lot of changes are going into Leiningen 2.0 these days, furious development it seems. What we can see here is the kernel of a feature to see all the dependency tree of a project from Leiningen itself without having to drop to Maven (ugh!), although this code is using <a href="http://www.sonatype.com/people/2010/08/introducing-aether/">aether</a>, which is part of Maven.</li>
	<li>Rich Hickey will be speaking at Clojure/West (via @ClojureWest) -- Very very nice!</li>
	<li><a href="http://reiddraper.com/introducing-knockbox/">introducing knockbox</a> (via @reiddraper) -- "It’s a library meant to make dealing with conflict-resolution in eventually-consistent databases easier. If you’re not familiar with eventual-consistency, I’d suggest <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/12/eventually_consistent.html">this article</a> by Amazon CTO Werner Vogels [...] Distributed databases like <a href="https://github.com/basho/riak">Riak</a> let you trade consistency for availability." This is actually one of the main pain points of highly scalable databases, no? Interesting work.</li>
