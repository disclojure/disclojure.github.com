	<li><a href="http://sritchie.github.com/2011/09/30/testing-cascalog-with-midje.html">Just published a guide to writing beautiful tests with Midje and Cascalog</a> (via @sritchie09) -- <a href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog">Cascalog</a> is a Data Processing library in Clojure that nicely wraps Apache Hadoop, and <a href="https://github.com/marick/Midje">Midje</a> is a testing framework that is seems specially suitable for the kind of testing that Cascalog users need. This article explains how to use<a href="https://github.com/sritchie/midje-cascalog"> midje-cascalog</a>, a library that enables Midje testing on cascalog jobs.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.exampler.com/blog/2011/09/29/my-clojure-problem/">A better explanation of why I am reconsidering my investment in Clojure</a>. Talk me out of it. (via @marick) -- So speaking of Midje, his author, a<a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/"> well known Agile proponent</a>, is putting forward some issues he's had with  <a href="http://bettween.com/richhickey/marick">the tone of some communications</a> with Rich Hickey, and his (oh-so-public) stance regards Test Driven Development (or even Agile) or other popular request (e.g. better error reporting). In the light of these incidents Marick is wondering if issues like these are putting Clojure at a risk of becoming a niche language, and hence not worth making further investments of his time. Ugh, I hate to write about these things, i'd rather write about monads instead. In any case<a href="http://i.imgur.com/X489j.jpg"> this cookie is relevant</a>. Now, if we could try to find a common place in which we all win instead of all lose...</li>
	<li><a href="http://repl.it/">repl in the browser for many languages. they need #Clojure though. Clever name.</a> (via @jmatt) -- Nice interface indeed!</li>
