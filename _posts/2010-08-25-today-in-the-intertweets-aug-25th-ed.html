	<li>#Compojure Demystified with an example - Part 4 (<a href="http://techbehindtech.com/2010/08/24/compojure-demystified-with-an-example-part-4/">here</a>, via @sivajag) -- Here are part <a href="http://techbehindtech.com/2010/08/14/compojure-demystified-with-an-example-part-1/">1</a>, <a href="http://techbehindtech.com/2010/08/15/compojure-demystified-with-an-example-part-2/">2</a> and <a href="http://techbehindtech.com/2010/08/16/compojure-demystified-with-an-example-part-3/">3</a>. This is a series about creating webapps with Compojure and Clojure.</li>
	<li>Looks like I can improve the Clojure section of DSLs In Action with the new Protocols introduced in 1.2. Non invasive abstractions FTW (via @debasishg) -- Those protocols sure are neat...</li>
	<li>I joined Los Angeles Clojure Users Group on Meetup (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Clojure-Users-Group/">here</a>, via @nickmain_ ) -- So there, there is a LA Clojure group now.</li>
	<li>Wrote up the details on getting #zeromq working with #clojure on #osx (<a href="http://blog.trydionel.com/2010/08/25/setting-up-0mq-for-clojure-on-osx/">here</a>, via @trydionel) -- <a href="http://www.zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a> is a (very fast) messaging library, meant to be used programmatically, as opposed to being a shrink-wrap solution. Making it work with Clojure is not a walk in the park. This article might help if you want to do that on OSX.</li>
