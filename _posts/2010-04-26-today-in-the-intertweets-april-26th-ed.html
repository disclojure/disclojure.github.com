<ul>
	<li>My new toy project: CSS generation from clojure DSL (<a href="http://github.com/paraseba/cssgen">here</a>, via @paraseba) -- Functional CSS? You have nested rules and mixins...</li>
	<li>Attempted easy alternative to #Clojure use/require/refer (<a href="http://github.com/stuartsierra/need">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- Yet another attempt at simplifying the namespace management in Clojure. The proposed notation is very compact and powerful.</li>
	<li>my half-hour tutorial on #clojure protocols is up (<a href="http://vimeo.com/11236603">here</a>, via @stuarthalloway) --The author of Programming Clojure, Stuart Halloway, presents this screen cast that covers a lot of ground with the upcoming Clojure 1.2 features: protocols. A must.</li>
	<li>Repeat after me: #Clojure contrib is not the standard library (via @stuartsierra) -- Clojure-contrib is not the standard library, Clojure-contrib is not the standard library...</li>
	<li>future pipelining helper macro in #clojure (<a href="http://gist.github.com/379630">here</a>, via @alandipert) -- Like a let, but wrapping everything in futures.</li>
	<li>Awesome! Robocup with #clojure (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2010/04/26/simple-robocup-simspark-agent-in-clojure/">here</a>, via @prism335) -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCup">Robocup</a> is an international robotics competition that involves robots playing soccer. One of the ways of participating is by using a robot simulator running in a soccer server. This blog post from nakkaya.com show how to connect to the server and move the robot's joints.</li>
	<li>Clojure's Approach to Polymorphism: Method Dispatch (<a href="http://www.developer.com/features/article.phpr/3878656/Clojures-Approach-to-Polymorphism-Method-Dispatch.htm">here</a>, via @manningbooks) -- This is an article about Clojure's flexible method dispatch mechanism from Amit Rathore, the author of "Clojure in Action"</li>
