<ul>
	<li>Planet Clojure now lists more than 250 blogs! (via @alexott_en) -- Congratulations!</li>
	<li>wish I'd seen these when I started with clojure and emacs. (<a href="http://www.pchristensen.com/slimecommands.pdf">here</a> and <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PareditCheatsheet">here</a>, via @deobald) -- Linked are a <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">Slime</a> (lets Emacs interact with Lisp) and a <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit">ParEdit</a> (a very 'different' way to keep your parentheses in check) cheat sheets. If you are using Emacs for Clojure, you need to have these around unless your memory is not like mine.</li>
	<li>Gasp, new blog post (<a href="http://briancarper.net/blog/579/keyword-arguments-ruby-clojure-common-lisp">here</a>, via @briancarper) -- A pretty long article about how Ruby, Clojure and Common Lisp handle keyword arguments in function signatures, or "the many different ways to skin the keyword arguments cat".</li>
	<li>javamatic - Templating engine for writing tedious Java code (<a href="https://github.com/stathissideris/javamatic">here</a>, via @_vojto) -- Wait, so you learn clojure so you don't have to deal with java, and what do you do with it? Write a java code generator. Really. Well, in fact I believe Rich Hickey himself is a <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/IFn.java">big fan of this method of writing java code</a>.</li>
	<li>Dan Bodart's sweet Java functional collection processing library (like Clojure, Haskell, F#, Scala...) (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/totallylazy/">here</a>, via @ codemonkeyism) -- <a href="http://code.google.com/p/totallylazy/">Totallylazy</a> is a Collections library for java that provides similar functionality than the clojure data structures, although the naming is more similar to the ML family of languages. Oh, and it is lazy. So if you have to stick to java, you could get a little clojurey with this lib.</li>
