<ul>
	<li>ClojureCheck is back. QuickCheck for #clojure (<a href="http://kotka.de/blog/2010/06/ClojureCheck_is_back.html">here</a>, via @kotarak) -- A specification-based testing library for Clojure that is somewhat based on Haskell's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck">QuickCheck</a>. It provides facilities to easily generate random test data in order use it to "prove" certain properties of the code under test. This article explains very well why such library is needed and how it works.</li>
	<li>Asking for feedback on syntax for mocking #clojure protocols using Atticus (<a href="http://www.objectcommando.com/blog/2010/06/13/mocking-clojure-protocols-with-atticus/">here</a>, via @objcmdo) -- The author added support for protocols in the recently released mocking library <a href="http://hugoduncan.org/post/2010/mocking_clojure_functions_with_atticus.xhtml">Atticus</a> and now wants to hear from you.</li>
	<li>Aff to @uberconf to do a full day of #clojure tutorials! (slides <a href="http://github.com/stuarthalloway/clojure-presentations/downloads">here</a>, labs <a href="http://github.com/relevance/labrepl">here</a>, via @stuarthalloway) -- Priceless slides.</li>
	<li>My take on relational mapping in #Clojure (<a href="http://formpluslogic.blogspot.com/2010/06/relational-mapping-for-clojure.html">here</a>, via @brentonashworth) -- "<a href="http://github.com/brentonashworth/carte">Carte</a> is an attempt to bring simple relational mapping to Clojure. It is also an attempt to do relational mapping in a way that complements Clojure." This article explains how Carte works, from model definition to querying the model.</li>
