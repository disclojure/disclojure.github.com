title: > Poll: (Almost) Half Of You Voted For Clojure-in-Clojure
---

To the question of "What is Rich Hickey going to unveil at
[Clojure/West](http://clojurewest.org)?", the majority of respondents
--a 41% -- voted for Clojure-in-Clojure (CinC). Roughly half of these
voters think work on CinC will start soon, while the other half think
that the work is well under way and kept hidden from us.

Clojure for Objective-C/iOS/cocoa was also quite popular at 22%, while
17% of the respondents dodged the question by answering "Something
completely unimagined [...]" boo!

Of note are also the write-ins, which we are listing after the fancy
pie chart.

Now don't forget to
[register for Clojure/West](http://www.regonline.com/clojurewest2012)
today, as the prices are going up after this Friday!
