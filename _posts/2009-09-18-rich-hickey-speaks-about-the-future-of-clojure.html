You can now find online the<a href="http://wiki.jvmlangsummit.com/images/a/ab/HickeyJVMSummit2009.pdf" target="_blank"> presentation slides</a> that Rich Hickey used in his talk at the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/mlvm/jvmlangsummit/" target="_self">JVM Language Summit</a> about the new concurrency features in Â Clojure. In this presentation Hickey explores the important aspect of Time and how observers might view the same dataset at different timelines, and how this time disparity is a key issue in developing concurrent software. A good read indeed, although I hope the video gets posed online sometime soon (maybe at InfoQ?)
