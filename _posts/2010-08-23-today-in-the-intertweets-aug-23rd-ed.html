<ul>
	<li>Alle drei Teile unserer Clojure-Serie im JavaSPEKTRUM sind mittlerweile online (<a href="http://www.innoq.com/de/resources/clojure-intro-neppert">here</a>, via @stilkov) -- For the German speakers (well, readers would be fine too!), here are the three parts of a series of articles on Clojure for JavaSPEKTRUM (Overview, Data Types and Java Integration, and Concurrency).</li>
	<li>Version 0.6 of the Grails Clojure plugin utilizes Clojure 1.2.0 (<a href="http://grails.org/plugin/clojure">here</a>, via @jeffscottbrown) -- Grails is a Groovy-based web development framework. This plugin lets you use clojure from within the framework, which makes it very easy to develop webapps and use Clojure in the backend.</li>
	<li>Securing #Clojure web applications with Sandbar - Part 2. Form-based authentication and channel security (<a href="http://formpluslogic.blogspot.com/2010/08/securing-clojure-web-applications-with.html">here</a>, via @brentonashworth) -- Sandbar is a library intended to work on top of Compojure/Ring and that simplifies writing web applications.</li>
	<li>Basic authentication for ring (and compojure etc.) (<a href="http://twitter.com/planetclojure/status/21940410037">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- Basic Authentication, but this time without Sandbar ;)</li>
	<li>A micro-manual for LISP Implemented in C (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2010/08/24/a-micro-manual-for-lisp-implemented-in-c/">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- Ok, bear with me here. Nurullah has a free weekend, and what do you normally do with a free weekend? Well, it turns out he decides to write a LISP in C. So he writes it, and it works. Let me ask here, how many of you pull this kind of software over the weekends?!? I don't. I would if I could though!</li>
	<li>Are we to static for a dynamic world? (<a href="http://kotka.de/blog/2010/08/Static_vs_Dynamic.html">here</a>, via @kotarak) -- The pros and cons of extending records statically or dynamically (speed vs. flexibility). Good insight, you might want to tread this, since these features are new to Clojure 1.2.0</li>
