	<li>Dmitry пишет: Hotpatch и декораторы (<a href="http://my-clojure.blogspot.com/2011/01/hotpatch.html">here</a>, via @fprogblogs) -- More about anaphoric macros. This time a hotpatch macro that lets you swap the implementation of a function. (<a href="http://my-clojure.blogspot.com/2011/01/hotpatch.html">here</a> is the google translated version.)</li>
	<li>Is there a software-engineering methodology for functional programming? (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4852251/is-there-a-software-engineering-methodology-for-functional-programming">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- Somebody asked at StackOverflow if there is any sanctioned software engineering process to be used while building software on functional languages. I'm surprised there is no mention of hammocks, but there is one about tar pits.</li>
	<li>TDD in Clojure with top-down-ness, abstraction, and #midje (video <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/19404746">here</a>, via @marick) -- "This is a demonstration of TDD in Clojure using a top-down style and greater abstraction than I think is common."</li>
	<li>Latest ThoughtWorks technology radar puts Scala in "Trial" zone ahead of Clojure and F# (<a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/articles/technology-radar-january-2011#Languages">here</a>, via @mushtaqA) -- Notice that the reason is because there is better adoption in the enterprise of today... but what about the enterprise of the future?! "We had expressed a slight preference for Clojure because it is the smaller and more focused language. Since the last radar we have realized that the wider applicability of Scala makes it more approachable for enterprise developers, and we have witnessed great successes in the adoption of Scala. Consequently we have moved Scala into our Trial category." You can find the fancy 'radar' graph <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/sites/www.thoughtworks.com/files/images/26/radar-languages-january-2011.jpg">here</a>.</li>
