<ul>
	<li>get 35% off on "clojure in action" and "joy of clojure" with the coupon code clojure35 (via @kevsmith) -- I don't know if there is any reader here that doesn't already own both books, but just in case: now it is a good time to buy them --&gt; <a href="http://manning.com/">here</a></li>
	<li>A possible addition to Clojure.future is "arbitrary functional destructuring", discussed at length (subject to change) (<a href="http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2009-11-17.html#10:05b">here</a>, via @fogus) --Judging from the #clojure chat logs, clojure is about to get a new powerful way of destructuring.</li>
	<li>My library for distributed apps in Clojure; Conduit. (<a href="http://intensivesystems.net/tutorials/conduit-motive.html">here</a>, via @jimduey) -- Distributed data streams processing, this is what it is about. The article describing this library links to more detailed articles, which elaborate on the theory behind this model. Very interesting read, but not for the faint of heart. I must admit it is definitely out of my league :(</li>
	<li>Thrush in Clojure (redux) (<a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2010/09/28/thrush-in-clojure-redux/">here</a>, via @fogus) -- It turns out -&gt; is mostly a <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/tx4/cus/combinator/birds.html">thrush combinator</a> (yes, they're all named after birds, how cute!). Mostly because it doesn't work in all the cases, one of them being anonymous functions, as it takes the anonymous function definition for a list, not for a function. The fix is deceptively simple. A must read.</li>
	<li>Dynamic mixins with clojure, an experiment (<a href="http://sbtourist.blogspot.com/2010/09/dynamic-mixins-in-clojure-experiment.html">here</a>, via @sbtourist)</li>
</ul>
