	<li><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk</a> Pretty cool. Only for Java but JRuby + Scala + Clojure apps can make it work (via @abhiyerra) -- This is a new service by Amazon Web Services. Now they offer Tomcat container services, which means that you don't need to do much more than telling AWS to deploy your .war file. No need to configure anything. Will scale automatically.</li>
	<li>Presentation:Clojure-Java Interop: A Better Java than Java (<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Clojure-Java-Interop?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">here</a>, via @infoq) -- "after reviewing Clojure’s syntax comparing it with Java, explains how Clojure-Java interoperability works. He then talks about the need for simplicity in languages, attempting to prove that Clojure is a simpler language, and consequently better, than Java." You might have heard this one before...</li>
	<li>I wrote a blog post about my upcoming book, Meet Clojure (<a href="http://blog.raynes.me/?p=94">here</a>, via @IORayne) -- Free as in freedom, focused on beginners, an attempt to being a prequel to The Joy of Clojure. Sometime in the future. A web version might follow.</li>
	<li>It's quite telling when InfoQ's "latest from Java" has the following titles: "Groovy Update", "JVM Languages", "Clojure", "Future of Scala". (via @steshaw)  -- !</li>
	<li>Lisp Cabinet - CL/Clojure/Racket all-in-one Windows installer (<a href="http://lispcabinet.sourceforge.net/">here</a>, via @hnfirehose) -- If you're doing Clojure, most likely this is not the only Lisp in your life. Get them  all in one package! (if you're on Windows)</li>
	<li>Introduction to Clojure Web Development using Ring, Compojure and Sandbar (<a href="http://techbehindtech.com/2011/01/19/introduction-to-clojure-web-development-using-ring-compojure-and-sandbar/">here</a>, via @sivajag) -- Short and sweet.</li>
