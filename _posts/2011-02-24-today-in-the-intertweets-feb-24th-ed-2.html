	<li>RESTful Clojure webapp w/Compojure, Ring, Enlive, and ClojureQL (<a href="http://blog.robert-campbell.com/restful-clojure-webapp-wcompojure-enlive-and?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- This article points at an application template to create RESTful apps, including DB work. It is very lightweight, and if you don't know where to start, this is a good place.</li>
	<li>The Future of #R is #clojure? (<a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/RUG/2011/02/discussions-on-the-future-of-r/">here</a>, via @algoriffic) -- This is a presentation about the fact that <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, a well known open source statistical package, is too slow and it is not scaling well to cope with the explosion of data of late. One of R's original author is longing for Lisp (R was originally a lisp), and the presenter suggests Clojure.</li>
	<li>Getting started with Emacs for Clojure development in Windows (<a href="http://blog.robert-campbell.com/getting-started-with-emacs-for-clojure-develo?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- An update summary on getting a decent clojure environment in Windows.</li>
	<li>Adapting a #clojure protocol to another protocol (<a href="http://david-mcneil.com/post/3495351254/clojure-protocol-adapters">here</a>, via @david_mcneil) -- A library that lets you define translations between clojure protocols at a global level. Pretty slick.</li>
