<ul>
	<li>Deploying Clojure websites (<a href="http://briancarper.net/blog/deploying-clojure-websites">here</a>, via @kicauan) -- This new article by @briancarper describes a method to put Clojure/Compojure websites in production. It is very detailed, and provides a lot of good insight on how to put together a nice development workflow, from code to production.</li>
	<li>I prefer Clojure to Scala because I'm conceptually far more interested in a pragmatic Lisp than a functional Java (via @bguthrie) -- I guess this sums it all! Nice use of 140 characters.</li>
	<li>Side by side: Python, Common Lisp, Clojure: Bayesian spam filter (<a href="http://www.machinelake.com/2009/11/25/side-by-side-python-common-lisp-clojure/">here</a>, via @tek_news) -- This article from last November is about the re-implementation in Clojure of the Common Lisp implementation of a Bayesian filter found in the book "Practical Common Lisp". This CL implementation is in turn based on a Python Bayesian filter. It is interesting to see how CL and Clojure differ in subtle but significant ways, and also how deep Clojure-Contrib is. The article is relevant today because the full source code for the Bayesian filter in Clojure by @xgavin has been <a href="http://bitbucket.org/gavinmcgovern/clj-bayes/">released</a></li>
	<li>More #Clojure #Swing fun, this time with layouts! (<a href="http://stuartsierra.com/2010/01/05/taming-the-gridbaglayout">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- and macros too!</li>
