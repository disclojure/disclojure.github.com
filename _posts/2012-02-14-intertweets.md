  nREPL is an initiative to provide an universal method to
  hook into Clojure's repl. This is looks promising: "My plans for the
  near future ... release an HTTP transport: a Ring handler that
  exposes nREPL as an HTTP API." A Clojure-in-the-Cloud? &rarr; __Cloudjure__,
  you heard it first here, in disclojure.
