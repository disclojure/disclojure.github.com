	<li><a href="http://www.philcalcado.com/2011/08/29/my_experience_with_test/driven_development_in_clojure_and_functional_programming.html">My Experience With TDD In Clojure </a>(via @offbytwo) -- Thoughtful article on how doing TDD can shape your code and make it even more functional and composable.</li>
	<li>What timing! RT: @InfoQ: Article:<a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/ieee-controlling-and-steering-open-source-projects"> Controlling and Steering Open Source Projects</a> (via @pjstadig) -- This is a thorough article about the many ways open source projects can be managed by entities, and how entities profit from open source projects. Now, to the "What timing!" part of the tweet; it looks like this article, in a timely fashion, relates to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure-dev/browse_thread/thread/c47d525d8f82333f/291df16f528933ff">a recent (hot) thread on clojure-dev</a> in which <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure-dev/msg/490eafe1dc29f5cf">the 'who' and the 'why' of decisions about clojure</a> is discussed. It also looks like this <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure-dev/msg/abe70eba5611cdcc">will be further discussed at The Conj</a> in November. This is important, fellows, be there or be square! (no pitchforks, please)</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/PaulSandoz/jenkins-clojure-console">A #clojure script console for #jenkinsci </a>(via @PaulSandoz) -- Hard to tell from the tweet (or the code's README) but it looks like <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> will be getting a Clojure Console. Now what can be done with it? not too sure...</li>
	<li><a href="http://def-learn.blogspot.com/2011/09/processing-zipper-structure.html?spref=tw">Today's #clojure post deals with printing XML stored in a zipper</a> (via @mambo5king) -- This is a non-trivial example of  how to traverse all the elements of a zipper in clojure. Always handy to keep these kind of articles around.</li>
