<ul>
	<li>Rich Hickey on Clojure in Clojure (<a href="http://vimeo.com/9090935">here</a>, via @superpants5000) -- This is a video recorded during the first meet-up of the NYC clojure user group, in which Rich is discussing the philosophy and motives behind Clojure in Clojure. Unfortunately the video cuts off because of battery issues with the camera.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Scala, JRuby, Groovy, Clojure: JVM-Sprachen mit Potenzial (<a href="http://it-republik.de/jaxenter/news/053626">here</a>, via@JAXenter_News) -- The readers of JAX enter magazine in Germany have voted about which JVM-based languages have most potential. The tally is Scala (31%), JRuby (26%), Groovy (19%) and Clojure (15%). The rest of the languages are far behind, the next one being Jython at 3%.</li>
	<li>Cool, a talk on the #clojure programming language next tuesday evening in Berlin (<a href="http://netzhansa.blogspot.com/2010/01/title-berlin-lispers-meetup-date.html">here</a>, via @pholdings) -- If you are near Berlin next Tuesday Feb 2nd, there is a clojure talk there in the Berlin Lispers Meetup (see link for details)</li>
	<li>la #clojure plugin for #intellij 9.0.1 is now available! (via @wmacgyver) -- Finally!</li>
	<li>My latest project is on github: Rincanter: R, Clojure, Incanter in the same REPL (<a href="http://github.com/jolby/rincanter">here</a>, via @jolby) -- From the author: "Rincanter is a clojure/incanter wrapper around the rosuda JRIEngine Java/R bridge. The hope is to allow easy access to an embedded R engine from incanter. It also offers translation between clojure/incanter datatypes and R datatypes such as R dataframe to incanter dataset."</li>
	<li>Nice, there's <a href="http://github.com/ordnungswidrig/compojure-rest">webmachine-esque</a> and <a href="http://github.com/rnewman/clj-conneg">content-negotiation</a> libs for compojure already (via @chrishouser) -- Nice to see how the <a href="http://compojure.org/">Compojure</a> ecosystem is growing :)</li>
	<li>Philly's Emerging Technologies for the Enterprise Conference just added: Case Study in Using #Clojure #AMQP #Chef #Cucumber #JRuby (<a href="http://www.phillyemergingtech.com/sessions/type/Languages">here</a>, via @jennrapp) -- The talk sounds interesting. There is also a talk from Rich Hickey himself "Clojure's Approach to State and Identity" :)</li>
	<li>Rewrote #clojure contrib.json again with Protocols (<a href="http://github.com/richhickey/clojure-contrib/commit/8b512d8fc228bd257d0601d7f4ac7592ebfab0c8">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- Good to see the new features of Clojure 1.2 being used!</li>
	<li>New little blog post: The Joy of Clojure, my perspective (<a href="http://blog.n01se.net/?p=80">here</a>, via @chrishouser) -- Why "The Joy of Clojure" is a different book? Because the book is not about programming in Clojure, but about Clojure the language. Just like how "On Lisp" relates to Common Lisp.</li>
	<li>Episode 9 is up (<a href="http://vimeo.com/9114362">here</a>, via @fulldisclojure) -- Sean Devlin's new screencast explains why the parenthesis in any lisp are such a key part of the language. For that he explores how in Clojure, code is data, and so a Clojure program is just an elaborate data structure. Use this video to convince your friends!</li>
