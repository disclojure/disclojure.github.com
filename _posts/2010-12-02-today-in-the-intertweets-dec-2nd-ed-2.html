<ul>
	<li>New ccw RC (Clojure support for Eclipse). Includes nREPL + new REPL UI. Thanks @petitlaurent! (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/counterclockwise/wiki/ReleaseNotes">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- This new version of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/counterclockwise/">CounterClockwise</a> supports the new cross-IDE repl infrastructure: <a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl">nREPL</a>.</li>
	<li>The first conj video has been posted! Rich Hickey, "Hammock-driven Development" (<a href="http://clojure.blip.tv/file/4457042/">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- I'll make it easy for you: if you write non-trivial pieces of software and you weren't at the Conj, watch it, but if you write non-trivial pieces of software and you did attend the Conj, just watch it again. This talk is a plea for developers to spend time thinking about the problems they are about to solve.</li>
	<li>URL Normalization in Clojure (<a href="http://www.xcombinator.com/2010/12/02/url-normalization-in-clojure/">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- This library will tell you if two seemingly different URLs are the same.</li>
	<li>Leiningen 1.4.0 was released tonight: tell all your Clojure friends! (<a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/NEWS">here</a>, via @technomancy) -- Interactive tasks while keeping the JVM running, shell wrappers for Windows, cygwin fixes, pattern based exclusions for jars and uberjars.</li>
	<li>First cut at an extensible compiler (<a href="http://offtopic.bestinclass.dk/post/2073377383/first-cut-at-an-extensible-compiler">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- The pace of development in ClojureQL is quite high these days. This article shows how to write a backend compiler for your favorite database so you can use ClojureQL with it.</li>
