<ul>
	<li>clojure compojure 0.6rc1 released. finally supports context! (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/compojure/browse_thread/thread/4f8574d808ddf53e">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- The new version of compojure provides a way to nest routes within routes, and some breaking changes.</li>
	<li>Here's an interesting approach to explaining macro writing macros (<a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Clojure-macro-writing-macros">here</a>, via @LauJensen) -- If you ever tried to break a macro into smaller macros, or write a macro that creates macros, then you probably know why everyone should read this article. If, on the other hand, you never tried those things, you're probably thinking 'what's the deal?', well, it's a big deal.</li>
	<li>Asynchronous Events in Clojure (1h38m video), speaker Stuart Sierra, Clojure-NYC 17nov2010 (<a href="http://vimeo.com/18970727">here</a>, via @gknauth) -- "How can we respond to events outside our application? How can processes talk to one another? Are Actors useful after all? What the bleep is RX? What about message queues?"</li>
</ul>
