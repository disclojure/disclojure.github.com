  The cat is out of the bag. A postmodern deconstruction of a
  database, based on the new theories of cloud space. Or something
  like that. It came with a [white
  paper](http://datomic.com/docs/datomic-whitepaper.pdf) too! Hosted
  in the cloud, mostly in-memory, you can go back in time, and many
  more otherwordly features. Also, it's got Rich Hickey in the
  #datomic chatroom!
