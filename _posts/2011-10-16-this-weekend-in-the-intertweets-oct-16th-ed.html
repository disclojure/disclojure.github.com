Although from the sound of it it would seem that Clojure should right away start using it, the situation is not that simple since Clojure already optimizes such calls. But there are still some reasons why you would want to have Clojure use ID, along with some prices to pay for such support. The devil is in the details.

Kudos! :)</a> (via @headius) -- Charles Nutter is the brains behind JRuby, a very very fast implementation of Ruby on the JVM, so when he speaks about JVM and InvokeDynamic, one should listen carefully. In summary, InvokeDynamic will be central to the JVM in the future and Clojure would be missing an opportunity if it didn't start planning on use it.</li>
