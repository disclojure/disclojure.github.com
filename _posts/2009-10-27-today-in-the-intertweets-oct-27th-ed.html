<ul>
	<li>Tim Bray's thoughts on Tail Call Optimization and why he likes the explicit recur call in Clojure (<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/10/27/Recur">here</a>, via @pjb3) -- It seems that Tim Bray is paying close attention to clojure and liking what he sees...</li>
	<li>A couple of SICP examples in clojure: Integral calculation with Simpson's rule (<a href="http://mattiasholmqvist.se/2009/10/integral-calculation-in-clojure/">here</a>)  and  Fixed-point calculations -- and square roots (<a href="http://mattiasholmqvist.se/2009/10/fixed-point-calculations-and-square-roots-in-clojure/">here</a>, via @m_holmqvist)</li>

<ul>
	<li>An Interview with @stuarthalloway about Clojure (<a href="http://pondjumpers.com/2009/10/27/episode-4-interview-about-clojure/">here</a>, via @publicfarley) -- you read his book, now you'll hear his voice :)</li>
	<li>Introduction to Clojure - A green paper from Manning  (<a href="http://www.manning.com/free/green_rathore.html">here</a>, via @amitrathore) -- you'll need to surrender your email to obtain the paper, but it is worth it</li>
	<li>I've played around a bit with the Clojure-like Agent concurrency concept in #scala. Hoping for some feedback (<a href="http://www.jroller.com/vaclav/entry/secret_agents_in_scala">here</a>, from @vaclav_pech) -- it is interesting to see the cross pollination of the concurrency features between languages. I believe Groovy is getting a similar feature in their GPar library for parallelization.</li>
