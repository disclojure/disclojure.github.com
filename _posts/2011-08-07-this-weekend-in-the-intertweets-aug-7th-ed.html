<ul>
	<li>MaxMSP and Clojure - together at last! as groundwork for our workshop at Cycling '74 Expo (<a href="http://www.cassiel.com/2011/08/01/clojure-in-maxmsp/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.cassiel.com/2011/08/05/clojure-workshop-expo-74-october/">here</a>, via @cassieldotcom) -- This one goes close to my heart. <a href="http://cycling74.com/products/maxmspjitter/">Max/MSP</a> is a platform for creating all kind of musical, visual, sensorial and kinetic performances. There are no limits to what you can do with it right now, but with Clojure, I bet you'll do even more! The author will be putting together a workshop on this too.</li>
	<li>Building generic wrappers in clojure (<a href="http://spootnik.org/blog/2011/08/04/clojure-wrappers/">here</a>, via @pyr) -- This article explains how wrappers like the ones found in <a href="https://github.com/mmcgrana/ring">Ring</a> came to be and why they are so flexible.</li>
	<li>"We are programmed just to do... Clojure code that's on a queue." (<a href="https://github.com/technomancy/die-roboter">here</a>, via @technomancy) -- "Die roboter" is a world domination plan using robots that execute, on many remote machines, clojure code sent by their overlord. Or something like that. See them in action <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHEoMpMvz7A">here</a> (Note: the tweet's author provided a link that didn't work, so I put one myself, which I think will show more or less the same)</li>
	<li> You can now request FPish author invites - <a href="http://fpish.net/">http://fpish.net/</a> #fsharp #scala #clojure #ml #ocaml #lisp #erlang #haskell #functional (<a href="http://fpish.net/">here</a>, via @fpishnet) -- "FPhish (ponounced as "fish") is a community-driven repository of functional programming events and learning material", and they're just starting.</li>
	<li>Brand new, high performance, clojure based twitter api --now all your tweets are belong to us! ! ! (<a href="https://github.com/adamwynne/twitter-api">here</a>, via @clojure_mexico) -- Except the ones that mention "clojure": those belong to me, muahahah! This new twitter client leverages @neotyk's <a href="https://github.com/neotyk/http.async.client">async http client library</a>.</li>
	<li>Hi guys, I made a Haskell to Clojure translator. Check it out :D (<a href="https://github.com/dmead/Clojure-translate">here</a>, via @reddit_haskell) -- Interesting that you would do this. (NOTE: The link accompanying the tweet is broken, so I supplied one of my own. I hope is correct). A quick glance to the <a href="https://github.com/dmead/Clojure-translate/tree/master/tests">tests</a> makes it look like there is some ground covered.</li>
	<li>Configuring logging for Clojure applications (<a href="http://blog.malcolmsparks.com/?p=37&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @yueliufeeds) -- This article explains some of the cool performance features of clojure.tools.logging and introduces a new library --<a href="https://github.com/malcolmsparks/clj-logging-config">clj-logging-config</a>-- that allows you to configure your loggers dynamically. This library currently deals with log4j and  j.u.logging,  and provides an abstraction over the two of them that makes configuring your logging infrastructure a piece of (clojure) cake.</li>
	<li>Porting the Hiccup #clojure HTML generation library to #clojurescript (<a href="https://github.com/teropa/hiccups">here</a>, via @teropa) -- This library is hiccup's counterpart for ClojureScript, and it lets you create HTML directly on the browser itself, with the idea of providing a more clojuresque alternative to Closure Templates. (Word has it that there is also another effort in a similar direction by <a href="http://webnoir.org">Noir's</a> author @ibdknox <strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/ibdknox/pinot">I guess it is public now?</a>)</li>
