The Intertweets have been buzzing with messages related to the fund drive to pay for Clojure's development. It looks as if Rich Hickey <a href="http://clojure.org/funders">has already achieved over 50% of his required funding for 2010</a>. Here are some of the relevant tweets today:
<ul>
	<li>Funding update - the Clojure community is simply awesome! (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/56e1620cbb325940">here</a>, via @technews) -- Rich provides an update on his funding appeal.</li>
	<li>rhickey: "2010 funding crosses the 50% mark" Let's take it the rest of the way! (via @chrishouser)</li>
	<li>Flightcaster Supports Clojure (<a href="http://measuringmeasures.blogspot.com/2009/12/flightcaster-supports-clojure.html">here</a>, via @bradfordcross) -- Thanks from all of us!</li>
</ul>
But after donating to the cause, our fellow clojure programmers (or however you want to call "programmers who happen to use Clojure amongst other languages and tools"... more on this in a follow-up post) went back to work...
<ul>
	<li>Hard-core Clojure (<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/12/15/Osborne-WF2-Clojure">here</a>, via @timbray) -- Tim Bray writes about his first thoughts after @atosborne's <a href="http://meshy.org/2009/12/13/widefinder-2-with-clojure.html">very fast Clojure implementation of WideFinder 2</a>. Tim dislikes that in order to achieve the kind of performance that @atosborne achieved he had to dip into Java Â (for AtomicLong and other concurrency related classes). It detracts to the purity of Clojure, in a way. He also comments that @atosborne's code might be less modular and less portable than desired. All comments are fair and worthy of some thinking.</li>
	<li>First a subset of Lisp was the new black in the form of Clojure and now Prolog looks like the next big thing (<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/24220/">here</a>, via @mdreid) -- From the Technology Review magazine: A Berkeley professor proposes Datalog as a model for easy development of applications for The Cloud. Meanwhile, some hackers are already using Clojure for such purpose.</li>
	<li>New debug-repl tutorial (<a href="http://georgejahad.com/clojure/debug-repl-macros.html">here</a>, via @georgejahad) -- How to debug macros with <a href="http://georgejahad.com/clojure/debug-repl.html">debug-repl</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://georgejahad.com/clojure/debug-repl.html"></a>Sean Devlin's recipe for turning my Clojure string interpolation macro (or, any macro, really) into a reader macro (<a href="http://fulldisclojure.blogspot.com/2009/12/how-to-write-clojure-reader-macro.html">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- Read the disclaimer in bold red before getting burned with reader macros :)</li>
</ul>
