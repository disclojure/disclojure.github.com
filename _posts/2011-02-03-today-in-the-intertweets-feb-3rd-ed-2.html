<ul>
	<li>Clutch 0.2.4 is out. Compatible with the latest version of #couchdb, and revision retrieval thanks to @objcmdo (<a href="https://github.com/ashafa/clutch">here</a>, via @ashafa) -- That would be version 1.0.2 of <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/downloads.html">CouchDB</a></li>
	<li>Another clojure rabbitmq lib has appeared. (<a href="https://github.com/mefesto/wabbitmq">here</a>, via @wmcgyver) -- "WabbitMQ is a simple Clojure wrapper for <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ's</a> Java client library (v2.2.0)" Very appropriate since we're now in the Year of the Rabbit</li>
