<ul>
	<li>@weakreference La Clojure plugin update is coming. Thanks for your patience and stay tuned! (via @weakreference) -- This is in reference to the question about the status of La Clojure plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.</li>
	<li>Racket vs Clojure (it's all about the data structures) (<a href="http://programming-puzzler.blogspot.com/2010/08/racket-vs-clojure.html">here</a>, via @kicauan) -- A long time Racket (scheme) programmer looks at Clojure and finds that the data structures provided, along with the ability to access all of them via the 'sequence' abstraction, are a very significant advantage. The author also provides some views on pros/cons of Clojure for real-world programming.</li>
	<li>Just posted an example of code reuse with #clojure protocols (<a href="http://fulldisclojure.blogspot.com/2010/08/thoughts-on-protocols.html">here</a>, via @fulldisclojure) -- If you were wondering how you could have inheritance with Clojure and its 'protocol' feature, here is your answer. A very good post if you come from OO languages and think that Clojure doesn't provide good enough tools for code reuse.</li>
	<li>Rich Hickey's #clojure "short" todo list: cinc, better method inference, letmacro, JSR 292, modularity, #android ... (<a href="http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2010-08-11.html#i34">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- ... pods, parallelism, primitives, scopes... it looks like Rich is getting himself and the clojure/core guys busy these days!</li>
	<li> At "0 to Clojure in 90 minutes" session by @trptcolin First foray into #clojure. #agile2010 (via @srayhan) -- More clojure at <a href="http://agile2010.agilealliance.org/">Agile 2010</a>.</li>
