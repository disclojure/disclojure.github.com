<ul>
	<li>Talked to @meporter about their #Clojure hosting last night...sounds like there is more news in this vein on the way from @contegix ! (via @puredanger) -- This is related to the newly announced sponsorship of Clojure by Congegix.</li>
	<li>add trace call to every function in a namespace ... and remove it afterwords :) macroes (sic) (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3346382/clojure-adding-a-debug-trace-to-every-function-in-a-namespace">here</a>, via @derartur) -- A pair of functions to turn on and off function call logging on all the functions of a namespace.</li>
	<li>Its tragic. My recent serious foray into Clojure and its functional/expressive greatness has totally broken my view of C based languages (via @markuskobler) -- It happens :)</li>
