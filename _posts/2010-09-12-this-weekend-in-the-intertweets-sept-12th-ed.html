<ul>
	<li>Quer começar com #Clojure?! Dá uma lida nos posts do @anderson_leite (<a href="http://andersonleiteblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/21/clojure/">here</a>, <a href="http://andersonleiteblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/26/clojure-hello-world-e-funcoes-1/">here</a> and <a href="http://andersonleiteblog.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/clojure-estados-2/">here</a>, via @abstractj) -- If English is not your thing and you prefer Portuguese, here is a list of introductory articles to Clojure.</li>
	<li>Once you get past the setup hiccups, TDD in #clojure with Emacs and elein.el (M-x elein-test) is realllly smooth. (<a href="http://blog.remvee.net/2010/08/19/elein_el_leiningen_functions_for_emacs">here</a>, via @trydionel) -- oohh! a leiningen mode for emacs!</li>
	<li>A Clojure "Scholarship": Let's send @IORayne to the Conj!  (<a href="http://cemerick.com/2010/09/10/a-clojure-scholarship-lets-send-raynes-to-the-conj/">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- So it turns out @IORayne is 16 years old and he can't make it to Clojure-conj because of the lack of funds (lives in Alabama). Chas Emerick reaches out to the community to fund his trip so we can all enjoy his company. Clojure/Core waives conference fee and pays for accommodation. Can we raise $1000 for travel and other related expenses? ... 76 minutes later:
<ul>
	<li>The first time I'll ever leave Alabama will be on a Clojure community funded trip to the first Clojure conference. I am geek, hear me roar! (via @IORayne)</li>
	<li>Thank you's, and details of how the Clojure "scholarship" for @IORayne came off -- Brilliantly! :-D (<a href="http://cemerick.com/2010/09/10/anthony-simpson-will-receive-his-clojure-scholarship-thanks-to-you/">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- The details of how it all happened. Congrats all involved!</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>pallet now has a leiningen plugin for running pallet tasks from the command line. (<a href="http://github.com/hugoduncan/pallet-lein">here</a>, via @hugoduncan) -- So in case <a href="http://github.com/hugoduncan/pallet">pallet</a> wasn't powerful enough, now you can run it from lein.</li>
	<li>(continuous) deployment of #clojure web apps by @cemerick 9-15 in NYC (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Clojure-NYC/calendar/14467899/">here</a>, via @jclouds) -- @cemerick will be presenting a continuous deployment solution based on, amongst other things, <a href="http://github.com/hugoduncan/pallet">Pallet</a> and <a href="http://www.jclouds.org/">JClouds</a>. This will be at the NYC Clojure meetup.</li>
	<li>(pre?)Announcing "Clojure Programming", the book, by myself and @KirinDave, to be published by O'Reilly (<a href="http://cemerick.com/2010/09/10/clojure-programming-the-book/">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- Well, today seems @cemerick's day! He'll be co-authoring a book with Dave Fayram. No details yet.
<ul>
	<li>Wow, soon there will be more books about #clojure than #scala! (via @mjanuszewski) -- not only that, the clojure books are also thinner!</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Clojure Macro Tutorial (Part I, Getting the Compiler to Write Your Code For You) (<a href="http://learnclojure.blogspot.com/2010/09/clojure-macro-tutorial-part-i-getting.html">here</a>, via @planetclojure)</li>
	<li>Froth: A Forth implementation in Clojure. (<a href="http://github.com/boredomist/froth">here</a>, via @IORayne) -- As a name, Froth is much better than Forthjure...</li>
</ul>
