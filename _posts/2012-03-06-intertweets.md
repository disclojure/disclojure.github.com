  It seems like this project had been dormant for two years and all of
  a sudden it started gaining massive speed. Mix
  [processing](http://processing.org/) with Clojure and make cool
  visuals. And indeed, a nice README.

  Marginalia is a [docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/)-style
  literate programming tool that builds a nice website for your code,
  making the comments very readable. New features are a leiningen
  plugin, ClojureScript support, 1.3 def docstrings and some other stuff.

  Stuart Halloway, of Datomic fame, put out some code that integrates
  the recently announced
  [frinj](https://github.com/martintrojer/frinj), unit of measure
  computation library, with the even more recently announced
  [datomic](http://datomic.com), an otherwordly database. Not bad, not
  bad... it took a whole day, even less.
