	<li>Just got an email from @manningbooks that Joy of Clojure has shipped! I've enjoyed the MEAP, but there's nothing like a book in your hands. (via @adamagus) -- Same here! What's best is that I had totally forgotten that I had also ordered the print version along with the ebook, so it is a nice surprise!</li>
	<li>Clojure is beauty! I've just been admiring my own code for the last 30 minutes, smiling all the time :) (via @tormaroe)</li>
	<li>Contract signed, repo set, I'm off to start writing the second edition of Programming Clojure #clojure (via @abedra) -- Woot!?! Another clojure book!?!!</li>
