<ul>
	<li>I've been writing my Clojure :import forms wrong for years but have recanted and turned around (<a href="http://p.hagelb.org/import-indent.html">here</a>, via @technomancy) -- It does look nicer</li>
	<li>ClojureQL - Beta2 now released Â (<a href="http://offtopic.bestinclass.dk/post/1679471439/clojureql-beta2-now-released">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- Some new features, including protection against SQL-based injection attacks.</li>
	<li>a redis protocol implementation in ~40 lines (<a href="https://github.com/ztellman/aleph/blob/master/src/aleph/redis/protocol.clj">here</a>, via @ztellman) -- Zach Tellman implemented the redis protocol using his very own <a href="https://github.com/ztellman/aleph">Aleph</a> set of libraries (including <a href="https://github.com/ztellman/lamina">lamina</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ztellman/gloss">gloss</a>)</li>
	<li>iOS autocorrects "clojure" to "cookies". Scrumptious. (via @abscondment)</li>
	<li>For those who are interested, the Clothesline preview is in Clojars (<a href="http://clojars.org/clothesline">here</a>, via @KirinDave) -- <a href="https://github.com/BankSimple/Clothesline">Clothesline</a> is a Clojure port of <a href="https://github.com/basho/webmachine">WebMachine</a>.</li>
	<li>logos, logic / relational programming for Clojure (<a href="https://github.com/swannodette/logos">here</a>, via @swannodette) -- A <a href="http://kanren.sourceforge.net/">miniKanren</a> implementation in Clojure.</li>
	<li>La #clojure plugin has been updated for intellij X. Has rainbow () support (<a href="http://devnet.jetbrains.net/message/5279103">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- Finally a sign of life from this plugin for IntelliJ IDEA. You need to download <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/IDEADEV/IDEA+X+EAP">the beta of IntelliJ X</a> to use it though.</li>
	<li>Making the No-Knead Bread (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13Ah9ES2yTU">here</a>, via @tbatchelli) -- Making delicious bread has always been considered to be a very involved enterprise. A healthy clojurian must eat healthy bread, so this video shows you how to make bread with a investment of time of 15 minutes. Please pay attention to minute 4.00, see how he is handling the extremely hot dutch oven with a pair of folded kitchen cloths? Well, using cloths instead of proper mittens almost always work. It didn't for me last Wednesday though... ouch!</li>
