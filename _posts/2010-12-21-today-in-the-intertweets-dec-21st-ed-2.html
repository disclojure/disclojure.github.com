	<li>We have a serious troll in our midst in the clojure mailing list. Fun times! (via @ghoseb) -- Oh no, trouble in paradise!
<ul>
	<li>Yes. Something similar has happened before (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/e60b5db288772c34">here</a>,via @vetoshev) -- Rich Hickey tried to fight the trolls before: his advice? Don't feed the trolls.</li>
	<li>why o why did i open that thread on the clojure list? havent i learned? stupid. stupid. stupid sean. (via @SeanTAllen) -- poor soul :(</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>JRuby/Clojure integration (<a href="http://chopmode.wordpress.com/2010/12/21/jrubyclojure-integration/">here</a>, via @chopmo) -- A step by step tutorial on how to integrate Clojure into a Rails on JRuby, using Incanter as an example.</li>
	<li>Scala and Clojure in the top 18 languages for 2011! (<a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Java-C-C-Top-18-Programming-Languages-for-2011-480790/">here</a>, via @xphree) -- eWeek magazine considers Clojure (and Scala) two of the 18 languages to consider for next year. Erlang and F# are also there, along with the usual suspects (C, Java, C++, perl, PHP, etc...)</li>
	<li>Blog post on writing digital ink applications with Clojure and OpenGL (<a href="http://blog.felixbreuer.net/2010/12/20/pengl.html">here</a>, via @felixbrewer) -- This is an awesomely detailed article on writing a handwriting application for Tabled computers using Clojure + OpenGL (via <a href="http://jogamp.org/">JOGL</a>) + <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/jpen/index.php?title=Main_Page">JPen</a>.</li>
	<li>@napple's been rocking the house on Marginalia (very-lightweight literate programming for Clojure) (<a href="https://github.com/fogus/marginalia">here</a>, via @fogus) -- Ohoooh!! Ohhh! oh! Yeah! Now now, how do we make this mandatory for all projects? Lein, Cake and Maven gents, make it so! This is a literate programming library for Clojure. What is literate programming you ask? Look <a href="http://fogus.me/fun/marginalia/">here</a>. Inspired by Coffeescript's <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/">Docco</a>, which is a great place to get inspiration from.</li>
	<li>New Clojure XML-RPC library. Looks like I get to deprecate clj-xmlrpc! :D (<a href="https://github.com/brehaut/necessary-evil">here</a>, via @IORayne) -- I find the name for the library "necessary-evil" to be quite fitting, specially for the "evil" part. I am just happy someone (other than me) is doing this.</li>
