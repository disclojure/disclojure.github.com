<ul>
	<li>Good video discussing point-free style, partial function application and composition in #clojure (<a href="http://vimeo.com/8665159">here</a>, via @RickMoynihan) -- If you are new to functional programming this is a good tutorial that shows what you can do with higher-level functions.</li>
	<li>The Joy of Clojure MEAP by @fogus and @chrishouser is now available (<a href="http://www.manning.com/fogus/">here</a>, via @opeckojo) -- Finally!!!
<ul>
	<li>New MEAP: Joy of Clojure by @fogus and Chris Houser - 37% off with our weekly mailer code (j1337) (via @ManningBooks) -- So there! use the code to get "<a href="http://www.manning.com/fogus/">The Joy of Clojure</a>" with a nice discount.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Fleet — Clojure template engine - Why? Because — I wanted template engine for Clojure — close to Clojure (<a href="http://flamefork.ru/post/334689288/fleet-clojure-template-engine">here</a>, via @flamefork) -- <a href="http://github.com/Flamefork/fleet">Fleet</a> is a HTML template engine for clojure for those who don't want to use HTML DSLs in clojure (like Enlive, for example)</li>
	<li>I just released dgraph, a dependency graph library for #Clojure. Reduce the pain of UI programming (<a href="http://github.com/gcv/dgraph">here</a>, via @vetoshev) -- "dgraph aims to offer a (mostly) pure functional data structure whose nodes behave like cells in a spreadsheet, i.e., they form a dependency graph", and "This data structure has many uses. In particular, it helps eliminate repeated clutter in UI code where the state of a display element may depend on the state of several other elements".</li>
	<li>@jneira pointed me at <a href="http://twitter.com/repleet">repleet</a> by @SpatialDefenter, a twitter account that will evaluate your tweets with Clojure code if you  the form of  "d repleet /clojure (reduce + 1 [2 3])". This is just a proxy to <a href="http://lotrepls.appspot.com/">LotREPLs</a>, which we featured here some time ago and is a web based REPL for many JVM based languages. The proxy is static, so I guess you can't define a function in one tweet and expect to find it when it evaluates the next tweet.</li>
