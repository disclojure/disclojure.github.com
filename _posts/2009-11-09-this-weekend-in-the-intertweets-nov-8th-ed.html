<ul>
	<li>So I am going to make his #clojure conference happen sometime in the fall next year "Conj 2010: The Year We Make Contact" (via @dysinger) -- that seems like a great idea. I'd definitely go...
<ul>
	<li>I am thinking #clojure Conj 2010 is going to be in the DC area &amp; most likely dovetailing with ICFP one day before or after (via @dysinger)</li>
	<li>ICFP needs #clojure people to submit papers to talk next Fall.<a href=" http://www.icfpconference.org/"> http://www.icfpconference.org/</a> (via @dysinger)</li>
	<li>ICFP needing papers on #clojure. ping me if you want to talk. outline due by Nov 20. This is one of the biggest FP conferences this year (via @dysinger)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>bleeding edge #clojure development using #gradle (<a href="http://m.3wa.com/?p=420">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- gradle seems to be chosen quite often over maven when the latter doesn't fit the purpose (or even if it does!)</li>
</ul>
