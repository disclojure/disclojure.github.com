<ul>
	<li>Sandbar roadmap. If you would like to help make a Clojure web library better, now would be a good time to start. (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sandbar-library/browse_thread/thread/fd68eca951581f4f">here</a>, via @brentonashworth) -- Sandbar is gearing up to a 1.0 release. Help is needed to make the code better, so take a look and see if you can chip in.</li>
	<li>Finally released a cloby gem: Clojure STM semantics for Ruby instance vars. Yeah, the name sucks.(<a href="https://gist.github.com/734247">here</a>, via @headius) -- Don't worry, we're just happy you didn't name it jrubyjure :). Cross-pollination in the works.</li>
</ul>
