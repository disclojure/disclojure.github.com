	<li>*Lazy* tail-recursive QSort in #Clojure from Chouser. Beautiful (via @fogus)
[clj](take 3
     ((fn [x]
          (qsort (take x (repeatedly #(rand-int x)))))
          100)))[/clj]
</li>
	<li>flightcaster, runa.com, incanter: It seems clojure's sweet spot is analytics! what accounts for this? (via @silkodyssey)
<ul>
	<li>dynamic functional langs are well suited to analytics plus Clojure's access to java libs (via @liebke, Incanter)</li>
	<li>one big reason is the functional aspect of Clojure - analytics is lots of math - the second is macros (for DSLs) (via @amitrathore, runa.com)</li>
</ul>
