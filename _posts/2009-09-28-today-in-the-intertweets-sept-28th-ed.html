The articles are named under the umbrella name of <a href="http://blog.thinkrelevance.com/2008/9/24/java-next-overview" target="_blank">Java.next</a> . In this article, Curt Sampson adds Haskell to the mix.</li>

	<li>Ah! And there were more hints that there might be a 3rd book on Clojure coming, this time from Manning ("Clojure in Action" maybe?) and apparently by Amith Rathore (<a href="http://twitter.com/amitrathore">@amitrathore</a>). Don't believe me? The evidence is <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=clojureinaction">here</a>...</li>

UPDATE: Fixed link in first article. Thanks for the readers who noticed!
