<ul>
	<li>Questioning Clojurize (<a href="http://anvil.io/2010/11/15/questioning-clojurize.html">here</a>, via @jneira) -- A few weeks ago Christian Smith <a href="http://anvil.io/2010/10/25/clojurize-the-data-not-the-database.html">proposed Clojurize</a>, a DSL to unify access to different data stores. In this follow-up article the author responds to all the feedback has gotten since it was publicized. It's a great read and addresses very important aspects of abstracting similar-but-not-really services.</li>
	<li>Continuing my exploration of under-appreciated programming methodologies, I've started a project to support literate programming in Clojure (via @fogus) -- This sounds promising :)</li>
	<li>A super-useful handy Clojure snippet for you: (def ^{:doc "octo-inc" :arglists ([x])} oinc (apply comp (repeat 8 inc))) (via @technomancy) -- Why did this make me think about the octo-mom?!?! Clever function though!</li>
	<li>Stuart Halloway on Clojure - Orbitz IDEAS (<a href="http://vimeo.com/15759323">here</a>, via @martinjlogan) -- Watch @stuarthalloway spread the word about clojure, if you haven't already (haven't we all? but it is always fun to do so)</li>
