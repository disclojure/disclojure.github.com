  Clojure-Py 0.2 Released! 
 author: planetclojure

 comment: >
  Clojure-Py is moving at a great speed, in part because the python VM is a very good host for Clojure. This new release brings us deftypes, protocols, reify, records, binding, defmulti and defmethod, hierarchies, try/catch and try/finally (but not try/catch/finally), beter python interop and much more (as in, 290 tests). Also, it can't be easier to give it a try with easy_install.

  Not only clojure is creeping into other host languages (CLR, JavaScript, Python), but also Leiningen is now creeping into [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/), a language built on top of the Erlang VM.

  ... or, how to get arround the fact that many python libraries require [GIL](http://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock), an unfortunate fact that limits concurrency in Python programs. Hint: actors
