  We don't get to report touching stories like this very often. Only
  tangentially related to clojure, this post is about an individual
  that decided to setup an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) store in West Africa, with the
  goal of getting more kids to interact and learn with electronics.
  The relationship with Clojure is that the author discovered Arduino
  while learning Clojure.

  Data Science with Incanter and Clojure. There is a [longer
  talk](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/home/practical-magic-incanter-for-non-statisticians)
  from the same author on the same topic.

  New #clojure reducers library  
 author: richhickey

 comment: >
  Rich Hickey introduces this new 'reducer' library that decomplects
  (ha! I need to create a new blog called 'decomplected') the
  functionality of operating over a collection, only to rebuild the
  functionality back in a way that is both faster and more flexible. It also lets you
  skip paying the price of lazyness when you don't need it. Finally,
  parallel execution
  when possible via Java's fork/join and other goodies that only RH
  can think of. There is a related [Hacker News
  thread](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3944229).
