<ul>
	<li>new page on starting a clojure user group: <a href="http://clojure.org/start_group">http://clojure.org/start_group</a> Feedback please! (<a href="http://clojure.org/start_group">here</a>, via @puredanger) -- Now there is no excuse for not starting your local clojure group :)</li>
	<li>The design for clojureql is starting to shape up. Still very open to input, see the README (<a href="https://github.com/LauJensen/clojureql">here</a>, via @LauJensen) -- A bridge between JDBC/SQL and clojure data types. WIP, so it is a good tome to provide feedback.</li>
	<li>Continuous deployment of Clojure web apps: my #clojureconj slides &amp; a pallet/jclouds/Hudson screencast (<a href="http://cemerick.com/2010/11/02/continuous-deployment-of-clojure-web-applications/">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- Chas Emerick showed us at clojure-conj a combination of tools that can automate your application deployment cycle. Since many of you couldn't attend the conj, he is gracious enough to provide <a href="http://chasemerick.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/continuous-deployment-conj-slides.pdf">the slides</a> used at that presentation and also include a 50-minute <a href="http://vimeo.com/16406320">screencast</a> to go with them. Oh, and also <a href="http://github.com/cemerick/clojure-web-deploy-conj">the full sources</a> of the example application used for the screencast.</li>
