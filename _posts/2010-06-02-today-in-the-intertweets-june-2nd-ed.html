<ul>
	<li>A trivial Stack implementation in Clojure using Protocols (<a href="http://paste.lisp.org/display/111054">here</a>, via @ghoseb) -- Short and sweet, thanks to the new features in Clojure 1.2</li>
	<li>Do you use Clojure, even a little? Then take the "State of Clojure, Summer 2010" survey! (<a href="http://muckandbrass.com/web/display/~cemerick/2010/06/02/The+State+of+Clojure%2C+Summer+2010">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- Do as he says... I hope we'll all get to see the results :)</li>
	<li>well tiobe is very relative but clojure is pos 16, higher than groovy, scala, jruby etc.. (<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">here</a>, via @jneira) -- Unfortunately Clojure is not in the list individually, but grouped together with other lisps, so it is hard to say where Clojure would be on its own. But I know for sure it'd be moving up!</li>
	<li>Test data in #clojure with #faker. Generate fake names, text, addresses, emails, phone nums, etc. (<a href="http://github.com/paraseba/faker">here</a>, via @paraseba) -- This is a port of Ruby's Faker library. Its usage is self-explanatory [clj](ns test
     (:use faker.name faker.lorem))
(def n (take 10 (names)))
(def p (take 10 (paragraphs))) [/clj]</li>
	<li>Did you know how to comment code in #clojure ? (<a href="http://kotka.de/blog/2010/06/Did_you_know_V.html">here</a>, via @kotarak) -- I personally thought I did. It turns out I was wrong. This is another excellent post in the series "Did you know...?" from @kotarak.</li>
	<li>CUFP #clojure tutorial outline complete. Come solve some real world problems with me using #cloujure, #incanter, and more! (<a href="http://cufp.org/">here</a>, via @abedra) -- This is for the <a href="http://cufp.org/">Commercial Users of Functional Programming</a> conference to take place in on October 1st-2nd in Baltimore.</li>
	<li>Come join us at the next #ChicagoClojure 6/16. Topic, what's new in 1.2 presented by @polgardy (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Clojure/calendar/list/">here</a>, via @jhirn) -- 6pm.</li>
	<li>Seattle Clojure folk: Seajure meeting tomorrow at 7pm. Be prepared. (<a href="http://seajure.technomancy.us/">here</a>, via @technomancy)</li>
</ul>
