<ul>
	<li><a href="http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/this">Working on #ClojureScript's support for this</a> (via @fogus) -- And when he says 'this', he means JavaScript's 'this', which is somewhat magic in JS. So now he is trying to make ClojureScript play nice with it. Wishing him luck!</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/The-REPL-and-Evaluation-Environments">Working on a new #ClojureScript REPL</a> (via @brentonashworth) -- It looks like the new repl will work both in the JVM world  and directly inside the browser, à la <a href="https://github.com/ibdknox/brepl">brepl</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/2011/09/02/clojure-hills-of-abstraction/">@fogus I respond to your Scala cliffs with the Clojure "Hills of Abstraction"</a> (via @puredanger) -- @fogus wrote an article about <a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2011/09/02/scala-is-for-drivers/">Scala's learning curve</a>. This article similarly describes the author's learning curve with clojure. As a summary, I'd say that both authors need better drawing tools ;)</li>
	<li><a href="http://build.clojure.org/job/clojure-test-matrix/jdk=Oracle%20JDK%201.7/">All #Clojure language tests pass on Oracle JDK 7</a> (via @stuartsierra) -- I still can't get used to the fact that 'Oracle' is in there...</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.match">match library has been promoted to clojure contrib as core.match. Thanks for the awesome library @swannodette </a>(via @redinger) -- Match let's you do predicate dispatch on pattern matching, which if you come from a language of the ML family you probably already know how this lets you write very clean code, and if you don't know what it is, the README in the project is already quite explanatory.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/jblomo/cljs-boilerplate">Big updates in cljs-boilerplate</a>: compiling #clojurescript and templates happens inline w/ #clojure 1.3, AWS beanstalk. (via @jimblomo) -- <a href="https://github.com/jblomo/cljs-boilerplate">cljs-boilerplate</a> is "An attempt to bring together the best practices of Clojure, ClojureScript, HTML5 Boilerplate, and Google Closure"</li>
