<ul>
	<li>Talked with two devs (1 java, 1 C#) interested in clojure but repulsed by emacs – no one had yet pointed them at the various IDE plugins (via @cemerick) -- This post started a long thread of tweets. Clearly newcomers to Clojure need to know about all existing IDEs earlier in their research. We do <a href="http://disclojure.org/where-to-start/">our part</a>.
<ul>
	<li>Adding clojure to an existing slime setup in emacs: The current recommended setup of emacs and… (<a href="http://fons.github.com/adding-clojure-to-an-existing-slime-setup-in-emacs.html">here</a>, via @mohegskunkworks) -- This is an example of why Emacs might scare new Clojure adopters away...</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>InfoQ Interview: Stuart Halloway on Clojure and Functional Programming (<a href="http://www.infoq.com/interviews/stuart_holloway_clojure">here</a>, via @infoq) -- Stuart covers a lot of ground in this interview.</li>
	<li>Variations on a parametrized memoize in Clojure (<a href="http://gist.github.com/330644">here</a>, via @cgrand) -- This is a follow-up response to @kotka's <a href="http://kotka.de/blog/2010/03/The_Rule_of_Three.html#summary">article</a> on how to write modified versions of memoize with different caching strategies</li>
	<li>Google App Engine (GAE) Blog mentions Clojure as a programming language for GAE. (<a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2010/03/app-engine-community-update.html">here</a>, via @smartrevolution)</li>
	<li>clj-native: see a C function being passed a clojure fn as a callback, great stuff (<a href="http://github.com/bagucode/clj-native">here</a>, via @kyleburton) -- You can quickly see how it works with <a href="http://github.com/bagucode/clj-native/blob/master/src/examples/c_lib.clj">this example</a>. Now you can use any native library from Clojure.</li>
	<li>New blog post: Yahoo Finance in Clojure (<a href="http://www.paullegato.com/blog/yahoo-finance-clojure/">here</a>, via @pjlegato) -- This is a re-implementation of a Ruby gem in Clojure by its own author. This plugin fetches financial data from Yahoo Finance. It is still slower than its Ruby counterpart, but the author thinks this is mainly because the Ruby version is using a native HTTP client library while his Clojure implementation is using Apache HttpClient.</li>
	<li>Mar 17: Clojure by Stu Halloway and Rich Hickey (<a href="http://novajug.wordpress.com/2010/03/01/mar-17-clojure-by-stu-halloway-and-rich-hickey/">here</a>, via @DavidValeri) -- If you are near Reston, VA on March 17 then you should definitely plan to attend.</li>
	<li>A little blog post showing how to integrate Rich Hickey into your Emacs buffer (<a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2010/03/approaching-productivity/">here</a>, via @LauJensen) -- Some notes on Emacs configuration, especially the IRC client (ERC)</li>
	<li>An in-depth tour of Enlive (<a href="http://github.com/swannodette/enlive-tutorial">here</a>, via @swannodette) -- <a href="http://github.com/cgrand/enlive">Enlive</a> is a selector-based templating and transformation system for HTML in Clojure. This is a very powerful library, but the documentation has always been rather sparse. This tutorial fixes this situation by providing an in-depth tour through all Enlive features.</li>
	<li>Russian speaking #clojure community at LiveJournal (<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_clojure/">here</a>, via @alexott_en)</li>
	<li>Reflections on leaving Haskell (to clojure) (<a href="http://www.alsonkemp.com/haskell/reflections-on-leaving-haskell/">here</a>, via @jneira) -- A glimpse on what brings other FP developers over to Clojure (hint: it's pragmatism)</li>
	<li>Setting Clojure's Log Level (<a href="http://www.paullegato.com/blog/setting-clojure-log-level/">here</a>, via @pjlegato) -- "Clojure.contrib.logging doesn’t have any way to set the log level. This is obviously a problem if you want to make use of various log levels (debug, warn, etc.) to separate different logging depths. Here’s a function to set the logging level on my default clojure.contrib.logging setup"</li>
</ul>
