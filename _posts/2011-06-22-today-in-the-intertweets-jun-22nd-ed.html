<ul>
	<li>Noir - The Clojure web framework (<a href="http://www.webnoir.org/">here</a>, via @hnfirehose) -- From the same guy that <a href="http://iwbyp.chris-granger.com/">will build a prototype </a>of your web app idea in 2 weeks comes a web framework built on the shoulders of the likes of ring, compojure, hiccup. You can find the Hacker News comment thread <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2682191">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Why Hammocks Make Sleep Easier #hammock_driven_development (<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2011/06/21/137300311/why-hammocks-make-sleep-easier-deeper">here</a>, via @looselytyped) -- If you watched Rich Hickey's keynote at The Conj last year (you coming <a href="http://clojure-conj.org/">this year</a>, right?!?) this article will convince you that the suggestion of using a hammock to think cannot be taken lightly, and the hammock cannot be substituted by any other means of sleeping.</li>
	<li>Clojure: Lisp for the Real World. Excellent talk (minus some comments about Erlang :-P) (<a href="http://ndc2011.macsimum.no/SAL6/Tordag/1020-1120.wmv">here</a>, via @_nipra) -- This is Stuart Sierra's talk at the Norwegian Developers Conference some days ago.</li>
	<li>How to Hack Overtone with Emacs (<a href="http://vimeo.com/25190186">here</a>, via @hnfirehose) -- A couple of months ago, we posted about a <a href="http://vimeo.com/22798433">presentation</a> about live coding with <a href="http://project-overtone.org/">Overtone</a>, a sound synthesis framework for Clojure. Many of us were impressed with the Emacs configuration used in that video. This video shows how to set your Emacs with many goodies that make coding Clojure a great pleasure.</li>
