	<li>@unclebobmartin 'Looks for Clojure at NDC' (<a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?ShowNum=678">here</a>, via @Sageniuz) -- I have to confess I haven't listened to this podcast, but it looks as if <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/omTeam/martin_r.html">Bob Martin</a> was pushing Clojure to .NET fans (well, I assume they are if they listen to ".NET rocks!"). By the way, NDC stands for <a href="http://www.ndc2011.no/">Norwegian Developers Conference</a></li>
	<li>I became inspired to write a #clojure #enlive tutorial. 2 parts drafted. Worth continuing?Â (<a href="https://github.com/cgrand/enlive/wiki/Table-and-Layout-Tutorial,-Part-1:-The-Goal">here</a>, via @marick) -- In short: go on please. <a href="https://github.com/cgrand/enlive">Enlive</a> is a HTML templating system for Clojure that uses CSS-style selectors and has a very functional feel to it.</li>
	<li>Writing Elegant Clojure Code Using Higher-Order Functions (<a href="http://christophermaier.name/2011/07/07/writing-elegant-clojure-code-using-higher-order-functions.html">here</a>, via @ maclausen) -- If you come from languages like Haskell or ML this will not surprise you, otherwise, I'd recommend this article that shows the benefits of writing code using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function">Higher Order Functions</a>, especially the functions that generate functions.</li>
	<li>Processing large files with Clojure (<a href="http://blog.malcolmsparks.com/?p=17&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @yueliufeeds) -- This is a very interesting article. When you want to process files that might be larger than your available RAM, then your approach needs to change. This article shows how to process very large files in Clojure.</li>
