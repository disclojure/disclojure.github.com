<ul>
	<li>Interesting presentation on #clojure. Language-as-data highlighted as key benefit (...) (<a href="http://slagyr.github.com/presentations/ClojureTheNewRuby.pdf">here</a>, via @revodavid) -- With quite  a title ("Clojure is the new Ruby?), this presentation contains a good number of graphics showing Clojure's ascending popularity. Watch out for some of the slides if you're prone to epileptic seizures... The slides seem geared towards Ruby connoisseurs.</li>
	<li>Published my slides from What's Next Paris "Clojure: Towards The Essense Of Programming" (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/hlship/clojure-essenceprogramming">here</a>, via @hlship) -- Some more slides, these are good for your friends that are none-too-sure about Clojure.</li>
</ul>
