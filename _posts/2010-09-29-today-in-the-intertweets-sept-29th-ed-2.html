<ul>
	<li>Emacs Front End to the Clojure Debugging Toolkit (<a href="http://georgejahad.com/clojure/emacs-cdt.html">here</a>, via @jneira) -- Instead of blaming myself for failing to report a couple of days ago on the advances in George Jahad's <a href="http://georgejahad.com/clojure/cdt.html">Clojure Debugging Toolkit</a> (which is what would be appropriate since he personally told me he was readying this version a couple of weeks ago,) I will blame him for not using twitter to announce these things! Ha! The debugger now has Emacs front end, with a number of commands to create, list breakpoints, go up and down the stack and stuff like that.</li>
	<li>Blogged about Rodney Leonard Stubbs, the simplest stubs for Clojure via Leiningen (<a href="http://technomancy.us/141">here</a>, via @technomancy) -- A new feature of Leningen that will let you run integration tests by (almost)transparently replacing real services for stubbed-out ones. When running tests, this lein plugin looks for special metadata tags in vars in your test code and replace the tagged vars with the referenced stubbed objects.</li>
	<li>Posted blog about micro-benchmark using Clojure 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 Alpha 1 (<a href="http://maurits.wordpress.com/2010/09/29/clojure-micro-benchmark/">here</a>, via @mauritsrijk) -- As 1.3 is progressing there is a lot of interest in its performance improvements. This microbenchmarks don't test any of the new static or primitive types enhancements, and even then, 1.3a1 is 10% faster than 1.2.</li>
	<li>A clojure stomp client implementation based on discussion in the irc channel (<a href="http://github.com/ninjudd/clj-stomp">here</a>, via @ninjudd) -- <a href="http://stomp.codehaus.org/">Stomp</a> is a streaming text oriented protocol that aims at maximum interoperability. The IRC discussion he mentions is related to <a href="http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2010-09-29.html#i56">using Stomp as a (suggested) wire protocol</a> for <a href="http://github.com/cemerick/nREPL">nREPL</a>, the networked REPL.</li>
	<li>Clojure 1.3 First Impression (It's Fast) (<a href="http://www.learningclojure.com/2010/09/clojure-13-first-impression.html">here</a>, via @HNTweets) -- The author of Learning Clojure talks about how with little changes his numerically intensive code runs much faster in 1.3a1 than it does in 1.2. Much much faster.</li>
