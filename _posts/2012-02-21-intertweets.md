  Well, well, well, why rely on a host OS and stuff like that when you
  can just run Lisp on specialized hardware? No idea of how you go
  from this to a flashed
  [FPGA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array).
  Time to reach for that
  [Verilog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog) book and see if I
  can whip out a CinV in a couple of weeks... now, where's my
  hammock?!

 comment: > This is a novel idea. Instead of _deprecating_ old 
  features, you _precate_ upcoming features; or basically, this project
  will grab your leiningen v1.x project.clj file and return a proposed
  leiningen 2.x one.
