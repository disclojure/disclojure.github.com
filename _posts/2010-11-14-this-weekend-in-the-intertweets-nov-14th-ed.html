<ul>
	<li>Introducing Clojail, a new Clojure sandboxing library (<a href="https://github.com/Raynes/clojail">here</a>, via @IORayne) -- Leverages the JVM's own sandboxing facilities, and makes it easy to configure your own sandbox for not-so-trusted clojure code.</li>
	<li>I had fun with this one: Clojure, Haskell, parser combinators, it oozes lambdas. (<a href="http://twoguysarguing.wordpress.com/2010/11/11/porting-haskells-parsec/">here</a>, via @natesbrain) -- Step-by-step porting of Haskell's parsec library (parser generator) to Clojure, with no monads (very prevalent in the Haskell world). This is the first article of what it looks it will be a series.</li>
	<li>Just launched <a href="http://emailatask.com">http://emailatask.com</a> written in #clojure free email-based task communication without an account. Easy links and reminders (<a href="http://emailatask.com">here</a>, via @emailataskcom) -- try it out!
<ul>
	<li>Posted first 5 episodes of #programothesis, it covers clojure and emacs and slime and more soon (<a href="http://youtube.com/emailataskcom">here</a>, via @emailataskcom) -- And when he said "more soon" he meant it. At the time of writing this there were already 13 videos. These videos are about very pragmatic stuff related to writing clojure code. Check them out.</li>
	<li>By the way <a href="http://emailatask.com">http://emailatask.com</a> uses the slice web library for clojure (<a href="https://github.com/scottjad/slice">here</a>, via @emailataskcom) -- Slice allows you to write web applications by writing composable slices of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in Clojure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>I wrote a tutorial on how to build a GUI with NetBeans and clojure (<a href="http://inclojurewetrust.blogspot.com/2010/11/how-to-build-gui-with-netbeans-and.html">here</a>, via @Kototamo) -- "how to create a simple GUI with the powerful Swing GUI builder of NetBeans, use it from Clojure and deliver it as a self-executable JAR"</li>
</ul>
