<ul>
	<li>Les hvordan Clojure tvinger deg til å programmere trådsikkert på (<a href="http://knowitlabs.no/?p=86">here</a>, via @knowitnorge) -- This is in Norwegian, in case you were wondering. An introductory article to Clojure and it's multithreading capabilities. Think of it this way: if you know everything about Clojure, you can use this article to learn Norwegian ;)</li>
	<li>Clojure type hints: WITHOUT (.frob obj) =&gt; lookup_method("frob").invoke() WITH (.frob ^String obj) =&gt; ((String)obj).frob() (via @fogus) -- If you were wondering how type hinds can speed-up clojure code that uses Java libraries, here is a clear example. With hints is a direct call, without them, it's a method lookup and an invoke() call.</li>
	<li>I managed to run clojure debugger toolkit on windows thanks to (this) message. (set-bp) power! (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/977aed52b5a0f560">here</a>, via @jneira) -- Basically you need to fix the directory dividers from "/" to "\" in the code, but this message already contains a patch for you to do that. A better patch is to get rid of Windows altogether... I'm just sayin'</li>
	<li>Seen in #clojure – October 7th (<a href="http://matthewm.net/blog/2010/10/13/seen-in-clojure-october-7th/">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- This interesting article dissects a code snipped that @chrishouser nonchalantly <a href="http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2010-10-07.html#14:20a">posted on IRC </a>on October 7th, and its purpose is to turn any number of minutes into months, days, hours and minutes. That's right, a code snipped needs a full blog post.</li>
	<li>My slides for the #jclouds and #pallet prez at #linkedin's offices for the Bay Area Clojure Users Group are now up (<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/39275742/Pallet-Bacug">here</a>, via @tbatchelli) -- Hey, that's me! If you're deploying your apps on any cloud provider, you should look at these slides to learn the basics about @hugoduncan's <a href="http://hugoduncan.org/post/2010/provisioning_cloud_nodes_with_pallet.xhtml">pallet</a> and Adrian Cole's <a href="http://www.jclouds.org">jclouds</a>. Maybe the video will be posted one day too.</li>
