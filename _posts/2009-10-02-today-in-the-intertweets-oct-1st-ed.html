	<li>Nice little #clojure <a href="http://clojure.org/cheatsheet" target="_blank">cheatsheet</a> (via @stuartsierra) -- Also can be found in PDF form (<a href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/richhickey/clojure/clojure-cheat-sheet-a4-grey.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>)</li>
	<li><a href="http://muckandbrass.com/web/display/~cemerick/2009/10/01/Java+is+dead%2C+but+you%27ll+learn+to+love+it" target="_blank">"Java is dead, but you'll learn to love it" </a>(via @cemerick ) -- great article from Chas Emerick.
