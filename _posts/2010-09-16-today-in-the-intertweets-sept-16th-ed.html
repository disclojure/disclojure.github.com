<ul>
	<li>so Oracle is closing talks about #Clojure and #Scala at JavaOne, are they afraid too many people might actually like them? (via @MichaelDMcCray) -- Is that true? I haven't been following JavaOne all that much lately...</li>
	<li>RT @LauJensen: Factorial of 5? Easy: (letfn [(!-?&gt;[&amp;$ &amp;!](if(&gt;,&amp;!,1)(!-?&gt;@(-&gt;&gt;,&amp;$,(*,&amp;!)ref)(-&gt;,&amp;!,dec))&amp;$))](!-?&gt;,1,5)) #clojure #eyeshurt (via @learnclojure) -- I had to copy+paste it to my ever open REPL. It produces '120'. How? I have no clue.</li>
	<li>Is Transactional Programming Actually Easier? (<a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4070">here</a>, via @letronje) -- "The [Transactional Memory] research community claims that programming with transactional memory is easier than alternatives (like locks), but evidence is scant. In this paper [...]" and a few paragraphs later "This paper offers evidence that transactional program- ming really is less error-prone than high-performance locking, even if newbie programmers have some trouble understanding transactions."Â <a href="http://userweb.cs.utexas.edu/users/rossbach/pubs/wddd09-rossbach.pdf">Here's the original paper</a>.</li>
	<li>Sort your Clojure ns clauses in Emacs, for kicks. Lots more ideas for useful stuff; this is just the beginning. (<a href="http://github.com/technomancy/durendal/blob/master/durendal.el">here</a>, via @technomancy) -- Called 'durendal', this new project from @technomancy aims to add all kind of clojure-related goodies to Emacs, like the one cited on the original tweet, but also compile on save, one-step initiation of lein-swank + slime-connect and paredit on the slime REPL. The to-do's are exciting too!</li>
