	<li>just created the detroit-clojure google group - If you live in the area and want to get all clojure-y, join us! (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/detroit-clojure">here</a>, via @ nhajratw)</li>
	<li>Use slim templates in your clojure projects (<a href="http://github.com/chaslemley/slim.clj">here</a>, via @chaslemley) -- <a href="http://github.com/stonean/slim">Slim</a> is a templating format originally for Ruby that is both fast and expressive. Slim.clj is just a of this template system to clojure.</li>
	<li>standalone clojure executable made with 'cake bin', just download and run: wget http://tinyurl.com/clojure-bin; chmod +x clojure; ./clojure (via @ninjudd) -- All the necessary clojure binaries are encoded inside the script (it's big!) and so yes, you only need to distribute this one file. You can produce your own binaries like this with <a href="http://github.com/ninjudd/cake">cake</a>
<ul>
	<li>here's a standalone #clojure that works in both windows and unix, generated with 'cake bin' (<a href="here's a standalone #clojure that works in both windows and unix, generated with 'cake bin'">here</a>, via @ninjudd)</li>
