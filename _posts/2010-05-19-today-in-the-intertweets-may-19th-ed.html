<ul>
	<li>Want to know something about clojure? (<a href="https://www.xing.com/events/clojure-stefan-tilkov-467817">here</a>, via @ckuetbach) -- Stefan Tilkov will be talking about Clojure at the DÃ¼sseldorf Java User Group tomorrow Thursday May 20th at 6.30pm. That's in Germany by the way.</li>
	<li>#Clojure 1.2 protocol gotcha: multi-arity functions work with deftype, don't with extend-protocol (<a href="http://gist.github.com/406504">here</a>, via @thnetos) -- clojure 'records' are closer to Java classes than clojure 'types', and they are faster too. But this speed bump comes at a price: flexibility.</li>
