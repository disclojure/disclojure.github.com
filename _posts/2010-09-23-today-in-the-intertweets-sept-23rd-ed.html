<ul>
	<li>For those who prefer their regexes verbose: a #Clojure notation/DSL for regexes. (<a href="http://github.com/cgrand/regex">here</a>, via @cgrand) -- Words are failing me right now. It could be powerful though.</li>
	<li>Yes, Clojure has regular old locks (see the 'locking' fn). They're often not appropriate, but when they are, don't be afraid to use them. (via @cemerick) -- Yeah, and on the same note, you can also use all the Java concurrency primitives if that's your thing.</li>
	<li>#clojure 1.3 alpha 1 (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/f65c4d8d8de17e0e">here</a>, via @stuarthalloway) -- So the first alpha cut of the master branch of Clojure is here. If you like being in the bleeding edge, but not really, then instead of tracking master you can use these alpha cuts. Please do, and provide feedback. Cool new features are: awesome primitive types support (very fast) and better exception reporting.</li>
	<li>SLIME for TextMate (sorta, Clojure)(<a href="http://blip.tv/file/4160578">here</a>, via @HNComments) -- A bunch of clojure hackers have put together the foundations for SLIME-like clojure support for TextMate, the OSX code editor that all the rubyists love. It heavily relies on cake in the background. Cool project, especially if you never managed to get the Emacs/SLIME combo to work. More info <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/2cd9e4d4884d3727">here</a>.</li>
