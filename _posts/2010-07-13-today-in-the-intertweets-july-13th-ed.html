<ul>
	<li>The Scala camp's answer to Clojure's Incanter (Yes, it's fun to pretend there's a rivalry between the two) (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/scalala/wiki/QuickStart">here</a>, via @MSch) -- Scalala, Scala Linear Algebra Library.</li>
	<li>How to setup Clojure from scratch (<a href="http://twitter.com/acangiano/status/18438488027">here</a>, via @acangiano) -- With emphasis on the "from scratch" part. Kids, don't do this at home without adult supervision. Use <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Lein</a> or <a href="http://github.com/liebke/cljr">cljr</a> instead.</li>
	<li>TheDeadline is now in the Google Apps Marketplace. This is Clojure/Compojure on App Engine. Consider my mind blown. BLOWN (<a href="https://the-deadline.appspot.com/login">here</a>, via ikai)</li>
	<li>Better #Clojure test results with deview. Shorter stacktraces and diffs. (<a href="http://formpluslogic.blogspot.com/2010/07/better-clojure-test-results-with-deview.html">here</a>, via @brentonashworth) -- From the article "Deview runs yours tests and reports test failures and successes. If an exception is thrown, clj-stacktrace is used to clean up the stacktrace. Deview will then filter it down to show relevant (according to me) trace elements" and "When a test fails, the difference between the expected and actual results are displayed" . Check out the full article to convince yourself of how awesome this project is. Source code <a href="http://github.com/brentonashworth/deview">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Changeset [9c01e1faf5]: prepare for 1.2.0 beta1 Branch: 1.2.x by stuart.halloway (<a href="http://github.com/clojure/clojure/commit/9c01e1faf5c3c81a6c06234c4ce6df7c2e1f79f4">here</a>, via @clojuredev) -- Does this mean what I think it means? If so, Clojure 1.2.0 beta1 is around the corner!</li>
