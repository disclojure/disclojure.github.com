<ul>
	<li>CLiki : SLIME Features (<a href="http://www.cliki.net/SLIME%20Features?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">here</a>, via @jsuntheimer) -- If you are using Emacs+SLIME to work on your Clojure code (if you are using @technomancy's Emacs Starter Kit or ClojureX or any other packaged Clojure installer, then you are using Emacs+SLIME) then this might interest you. It is a short summary of all the features of SLIME.</li>
	<li>A Simple Clojure IRC Client: The other night I was toying with the following script, I was going to thrash it but ... (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2010/02/10/a-simple-clojure-irc-client/">here</a>, via @lazycoderLinks) -- Yet another excellent article from nakkaya.com, and this time about creating an IRC client with only a few lines of Clojure.</li>
	<li>Implementing a #Clojure counterpart to the slime/swank #RPC module, providing better compatibility with MCLIDE (<a href="http://mclide.in-progress.com/">here</a>, via @MCLIDE) -- MCLide is an open source Macintosh IDE for Lisp. Works with many lisps, but not yet with Clojure.
<ul>
	<li>#Clojure support in #MCLIDE is in the works. The remote REPL and more already works well (via @MCLIDE)</li>
</ul>

	<li>My first contribution to [Spanish] wikipedia (<a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure">here</a>, via @jneira) -- Now Clojure has a Spanish wikipedia page!</li>
	<li>Clojure Hispano <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure-hispano">http://groups.google.com/group/clojure-hispano</a> (via @ajlopez) -- The Spanish-speaking Clojure list was created quite a while ago, but just now it got its first message. I hope we'll see many more in the future!</li>
