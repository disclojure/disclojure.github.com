<ul>
	<li>June London Clojure Dojo - 29 Jun - City of London, UK (<a href="http://www.developerfusion.com/event/84091/june-london-clojure-dojo/">here</a>, via @ukdevevents)</li>
	<li>calx, a opencl wrapper for #clojure (<a href="http://github.com/ztellman/calx">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- "Calx is an idiomatic wrapper for OpenCL, which is an abstraction layer for parallel computation" . Work in progress.</li>
	<li>#clojure "equal" branch updated again, now it auto box loop arg when recur mismatch happens, also gives warning (<a href="http://github.com/richhickey/clojure/commit/0df995dc6d31a9f4d0fe199bc63c4abfac7c86b1">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- Quoting Rich Hickey "I've added the speculative analysis required to detect when recur  arguments fail to match the type of primitive loop locals, and  recompile the loop with those loop args boxed. When *warn-on-reflection* is true it will issue a report that this is happening and why". At this point, if you don't know what this is about, start reading <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/c8c850595c91cc11">here</a>, you only have 196 posts to go...</li>
	<li>never before have i managed to refactor code using common #lisp. #clojure has it working(early but functional state!) (<a href="http://github.com/tcrayford/clojure-refactoring">here</a>, via @edgargoncalves) -- A few nice refactorings in there: thread, unthread, extract fn, and more!</li>
	<li>Pallet, #clojure based cloud provisioning, configuration and administration, release 0.1 (<a href="http://github.com/hugoduncan/pallet/tree/0.1-release">here</a>, via @hugoduncan) -- So there: release 0.1 is out; get it while it's fresh.</li>
	<li>(take... An ongoing series of micro-interviews with Clojure hackers. First up: David Edgar Liebke. (<a href="http://twitter.com/fogus/status/16737444782">here</a>, via @fogus) -- Aptly titled as "(take 8 (david-edgar-liebke))", this is the first in a future series of short interviews with noted Clojurians/ers/istas. This first one is with the creator of <a href="http://incanter.org/">Incanter</a>.</li>
