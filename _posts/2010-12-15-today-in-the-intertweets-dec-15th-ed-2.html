	<li>Dynamic/static duality in Clojure compilation -- AOT vs source (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/leiningen/browse_thread/thread/4690aab4bcccea25/8d005c078684a91f">here</a>, via @kumarshantanu) -- A discussion in the Leiningen list about the different oddities of AOT compilation.</li>
	<li>[...] hopefully the official launcher ideas will get some momentum. (<a href="http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/CLJ+Launcher">here</a>, via @trptcolin) -- Oh, how did I miss this one. It looks like we might have an 'official' clojure launcher application, so newbies don't get overwhelmed with the many different ways to start a clojure REPL.</li>
	<li>Emblogginated: "Unification versus Pattern Matchingâ€¦ to the death!" (<a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2010/12/14/unification-versus-pattern-matching-to-the-death/">here</a>, via @fogus) -- If you ever wondered why unification when there is pattern matching (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/dcolthorp/matchure">matchjure</a>)</li>
	<li>Writing clojure is fun, but I need to sleep... Or not. Writing clojure is fun (via @paraseba) -- ... and that is the reason why I am up late writing this :)</li>
