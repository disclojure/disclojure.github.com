<ul>
	<li>a question on hacker news... chime in... "why should i care about #clojure?" (<a href="http://twitter.com/SeanTAllen/status/18608280114">here</a>, via @SeanTAllen) -- In order to motivate you to chime in, here is the mandatory link to "<a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">somebody is wrong on the Internet"</a></li>
	<li>Next #clojure training at Mountain View on July 31st by @arathore and me - only 6 spots left (<a href="http://www.proclojure.com/">here</a>, via @sivajag) -- If you are in the Bay Area and want to learn Clojure from the pros, here is your chance.</li>
	<li>Get @chrishouser's "The Joy of Clojure" for %40 off until July 22nd with code ju1540 (<a href="http://joyofclojure.com/">here</a>, via @fogus) -- Just in case there is any reader that doesn't have it already...</li>
	<li>most watched java project on github - clojure :]Â (via @pbadenski) -- How is that a Java project?</li>
	<li>Aw shucks, that upstart Norvig knocked #Clojure off #1 (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/3981/">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- Nah, it didn't. Not at least when I checked it out; "Practical Clojure" is, at the time of writing this, #1 in the "Bestsellers in Lisp" category :)</li>
</ul>
A quick note from your humble Clojure Tweets curator: I'll be going to the <a href="http://emerginglangs.com/">Emerging Languages Camp</a> next week, driving up to Portland, OR from the Bay Area with my family. My wife is in charge of getting us rooms along the way, and I know for a fact that one night we're staying at a farm, sooooo... my Internet access during the next week is very up in the air, and the Intertweets might not come daily.

If you're also going, then I hope I'll see you there!
