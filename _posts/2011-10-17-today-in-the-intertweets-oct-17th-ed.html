Noticed that every time you use some library against a server/service, the library follows one of these two approach: either you pass a session at each request, or the session is set via a binding (e.g. with-session). You might not like the option chosen by the library maker, but you have no recourse. This article is about how to have your cake and eat it too.</li>
