<ul>
	<li>Scala classes in clojure (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3555008/scala-classes-in-clojure">here</a>, via @ScalaAtSO) -- That's right: make love, not war. It's refreshing to see Scala and Clojure in the same sentence without a 'vs.' in between.</li>
	<li>Are github-hosted repos the maven gateway drug for my Clojure brethren? Sorry guys: it's a fact of life on the JVM.(<a href="http://cemerick.com/2010/08/24/hosting-maven-repos-on-github/">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- Yes, it is a fact of life that your project will be broken into a few modules that might evolve concurrently, and you'll have to manage their dependencies.  This article is actually only tangentially related to Clojure, as it applies to Java itself and all the other JVM-based languages. The fact of life is that you will need to setup a Maven repository which, as the article proposes, can be done without adding much infrastructure overhead.</li>
