	<li>“Exploring Clojure multimethods with the universal design pattern” (here, via @fogus) -- A free excerpt of the book "The Joy of Clojure" by @fogus and @chrishouser</li>
	<li>1K cores w/o cache coherency - Not so good for Clojure (<a href="http://www.goodgearguide.com.au/article/368762/intel_1_000-core_processor_possible/">here</a>, via @lispcoder) -- Interesting article about how Intel plans to scale up to 1000 cores in once chip. The key seems to be to abandon cache coherence and go for message passing. I guess the "Not so good for Clojure" part refers to the latter. This design actually seems to be along the lines of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_Machine">Connection Machine</a>, so Lisp should be just fine. Man! If only I could get my hands on one of those! Xmas tree forever!</li>
	<li>In action - #clojure #websockets #aleph #iOS4.2 (<a href="http://blip.tv/file/4416201">here</a>, via @swannodette) -- This tweet only needs #ladygaga to beat the World Record of cool hashtags in a tweet (just kidding, #justinbieber is now cooler than the gaga lady). Watch the video. Drool. It shows the browsers of an iPad and a PC being synchronized via websockets and aleph. And it's FAST!</li>
