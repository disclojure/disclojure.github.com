<ul>
	<li>Cool computer vision project, movement detection in just 100 lines of clojure with opencv! (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2010/01/19/clojure-opencv-detecting-movement/">here</a>, via @RickMoynihan) -- Another interesting article from nakkaya.com on the use of Clojure and <a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/">OpenCV</a> to perform motion detection with a webcam.</li>
	<li>First steps toward defining clojure-in-clojure (all caveats apply) (<a href="https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Clojure_Compiler_in_Clojure">here</a>, via @fogus) Â -- Clojure in Clojure refers to writing a clojure compiler and runtime in Clojure (or as much of it as possible). The possibilities that this opens are just crazy.</li>
	<li>Agents of swing ported from swing to #jwt with #clojure (<a href="http://www.nsa.be/index.php/eng/Blog/From-Swing-to-Jwt">here</a>, via @Raphinou) --<a href="http://webtoolkit.eu/jwt#/">JWt</a> is a widget-centric (a la destktop GUI) Java library for developing interactive web apps that can be deployed within standard Java Servlet containers. What the author did was adapt @stuartsierra's <a href="http://stuartsierra.com/2010/01/08/agents-of-swing">Agents of Swing</a> application to work with JWt instead of Swing. The ease in which this porting was done validates @stuartsierra's design.</li>
	<li>Flightcaster (YC S09) Wins the Amazon Payments Prize (<a href="https://payments.amazon.com/sdui/sdui/startupchallenge">here</a>, via @rberger) -- <a href="http://flightcaster.com">Fligtcaster.com</a> uses clojure as part of their arsenal. Good to see clojure getting more spotlight! Congrats Flightcaster!</li>
