	<li>rhickey on #clojure IRC: "I just want a simple [build] story for people who don't want to waste their lives on maven." Amen. (via @briancarper) -- That's what he said.</li>
	<li>ClojureW - One click Clojure set up, now supports Cygwin. It is now truly cross platform environment (via @ktuman)</li>

	<li>The more I look at clojure the more seriously I take it. It may be that scala and F# took the wrong approach. (via @unclebobmartin) -- Robert Martin (uncle Bob) is no small fish. He is a well known author and founder of Object Mentor, soon to be renamed Function Mentor I guess...</li>
	<li>Simple way of obtaining a #clojure repl on Ubuntu: $ sudo apt-get install clojure $ clojure user=&gt; (+ 1 2 3) =&gt; 6 (via @cleotd) -- Follow @cleotd on twitter and you'll get at least one of these useful tidbits every day! Recommended.</li>

If for some reason you don't like using ELPA (emacs' package management system) then getting swank to work becomes pretty hard. This post provides some tips for getting it to work without ELPA.</li>
