<ul>
	<li>Clojure Entity Component System  (<a href="http://resatori.com/clojure-entity-component-system">here</a>, via @hnfirehose) -- This <a href="http://cowboyprogramming.com/2007/01/05/evolve-your-heirachy/">Entity Component System</a> references the creation of game entities as an aggregation of different components as opposed of the mainstream model which is based on deep hierarchies. This article shows how to use this technique in Clojure.</li>
	<li>Clojure gives you a usable stack trace when an error occurs. Node.js is all callbacks so no stack. (via @mperham) -- "usable" and "clojure stack trace" in the same sentence with a favorable tone, that is something I didn't expect. Could it be that for some the bar for usability is pretty low?... or maybe node.js stack traces are encrypted with triple-DES.</li>
	<li>Get your Prolog on (<a href="http://dosync.posterous.com/pattern-matching">here</a>, via @swannodette) -- David Nolen has been implementing a mini-Kanren, a declarative logic programming language, on top Clojure for quite a while. One of the drawbacks of mini-Kanren is that programs tend to be very verbose, at least compared to Prolog.  Not any longer...</li>
	<li>Clojure Programming: Chas Emerick, Brian Carper, Christophe Grand[Aug 15, 2011] (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/1449394701/amazonbook021-20/ref=nosim?newgoodzT=2011033&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">here</a>, via @us_java) -- Nice list of authors! This is an upcoming book to be published by O'Reilly and it is shaping really nice!</li>
