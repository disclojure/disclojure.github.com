  "Frinj is a practical unit-of-measure calculator DSL for Clojure.".
  Inspired in [Frink](http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/), a language that
  has, amongst many other awesome features, support for units of measure. There is even [a port](https://github.com/martintrojer/frinj/blob/master/src/frinj/examples.clj) of
  one of the [Frink
  demos](http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/#SampleCalculations). Check
  them both!

  New blog post on code that explains itself

  This is an interesting concept that I would like to see more in the
  clojure world. An `explain` function that will tell you what a piece
  of code will do.

  static code analyzer for Clojure code powered by core.logic

 comment: >
  There are not many transformations implemented yet, but this
  analyzer will propose better forms for part of your code, for
  example, change an `if` with no `else` with a `when`.

  If you are familiar with
  [GATK](http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsa/wiki/index.php/The_Genome_Analysis_Toolkit)
  then you must be a mad scientist playing with the gnome. If not,
  well, now you can, with Clojure, of course. Now think about the power
  of a `clone` function in conjunction with `doseq`...
