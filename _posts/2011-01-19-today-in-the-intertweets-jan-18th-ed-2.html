<ul>
	<li>Nice Clojure demo midje test like writing prolog.. RT @unclebobmartin: STUB5: Prolog, Midje, and Test Specifications. (<a href="http://cleancoder.posterous.com/stub5-prolog-midje-and-test-specifications">here</a>, via @tux2323) -- So Midje, a testing framework for clojure, is basically a Prolog, a logic programming language. Since Prolog is a Turing-complete language (as Lisp is), then you technically can write your code in logic style with Midje, instead of using the functional style of clojrue. In the example in the linked video, you can see how Bob Martin wrote the same function twice: one is the function to test, and is written in functional style, and then there is the test function, written in logic style. They are equivalent!</li>
	<li>Switch to non-promoting math ops by default in CClojure 1.3 seems like a bad design decision. Robustness &gt; performance. (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/506d97b0c016f3cd">here</a>, via @mstepniowski) -- And here we go again. Definitely this issue is less than settled, except that it looks like Rich Hickey has already made up his mind, and we all know what that usually means...</li>
	<li>This is a useful little library. It intelligently reloads all your Clojure src in live runtime, avoiding JVM startup. (<a href="https://github.com/slagyr/fresh">here</a>, via @slagyr)</li>
	<li>Ideas about asynchronous functions, inspired by @puredanger 's concurrent framework postÂ (<a href="https://github.com/ztellman/lamina/wiki/Asynchronous-functions">here</a>, via @ztellman) -- This post shows how to write asynchronous functions with <a href="https://github.com/ztellman/lamina">Lamina</a>, an event-driven workflow framework. With this solutions you could achieve large concurrency with little wait-related overhead. This is in response to <a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/2011/01/14/comparing-concurrent-frameworks/">this post</a> from two days ago.</li>
