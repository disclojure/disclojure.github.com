<ul>
	<li>Episode 10 is up - Intro to Macros (<a href="http://vimeo.com/9286834">here</a>, via @fulldisclojure) -- Sean Devlin produces another screen cast, this time covering Macros in clojure.</li>
	<li>New TIOBE index: Scratch, Scala, Erlang and JavaFX Script on the way to top 20. Now where is my fav language Clojure? (<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">here</a>, via @mauritsrijk) -- Clojure doesn't even figure in the top 50. That means this year will be very exciting and we'll take the language into the top 20 :)</li>
	<li>What are common conventions for working with namespaces in Clojure? (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2223190/what-are-common-conventions-for-using-namespaces-in-clojure">here</a>, via @puredanger) -- Interesting question. The answers are of common sense, but only after you've read them.</li>
	<li>Requiring all possible namespaces (<a href="http://learnclojure.blogspot.com/2010/02/requiring-all-possible-namespaces.html">here</a>, via @jneira) -- Ever wanted to find the documentation for a function while at the REPL and found that you needed to 'require' the namespace in order for 'doc' to work? Well, here is a solution to 'require' all namespaces at once, so that this does not happen to you again.</li>
	<li>We're also OSGi, I'd love to sprinkle some clojure but I don't think its OSGi safe yet, and its a much bigger mind shift (via @talios)
<ul>
	<li>Not sure what "OSGi safe" is, but the clojure/OSGi combination appear to work for some definition of that (<a href="http://lambdalounge.org/2010/01/28/polyglot-osgi-in-february/">here</a>, via @cemerick)</li>
	<li>Clojure has loaded classes using the context classloader for some time now (via @cemerick)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Clojure app on Google App Engine (<a href=" https://the-deadline.appspot.com/">here</a>, via @sthuebner) -- The guys at <a href="http://freitheit.com">freitheit.com</a> (proud funders of Clojure) have this AI based personal assistant written in clojure and up on Google App Engine.</li>
	<li>I blogged about factors that made me choose #clojure as my replacement for python (<a href="http://brehaut.net/blog/2010/a_couple_of_lists">here</a>, via @brehaut) -- It's nice to see Clojure from a pythonista's eyes. Sometimes we take some things for granted while working in Clojure.</li>
	<li>Why I love everything you hate about Java (<a href="http://magicscalingsprinkles.wordpress.com/2010/02/08/why-i-love-everything-you-hate-about-java/">here</a>, via @emcconne_reads) -- This is tangentially related to Clojure; it is more of a critique on higher level languages in a high-performance production environment. It argues that having the fine-grained level of control that Java provides you is key to manage high performance in large scale systems. Interesting read if you are planning on building a large system in Clojure.</li>
