<ul>
	<li>Announcing borneo - a clojure wrapper for Neo4j graph database. (<a href="https://github.com/wagjo/borneo">here</a>, via @wagjo) -- This is <a href="https://github.com/JulianMorrison/neo4j-clojure">not the first</a> neo4j client for Clojure, and this implementation differs from clojure-neo4j in significant ways. <a href="http://neo4j.org/">Neo4j</a> is a graph database (for java).</li>
	<li>Music as Data (MAD) - Live programming music in Clojure (<a href="http://jon.is.emotionull.com/post/3763284693/music-as-data-mad-live-programming-music-in-clojure">here</a>, via @jonromero) -- (play! [A4 [B4 D#5]])  --&gt; music!</li>
	<li>POJP = Plain Old Java Programmer: A JVM based developer who knows only the #Java programming language (via @aloiscochard)</li>
	<li>Rummage v0.0.1 released – a Clojure client library for Amazon’s SimpleDB (SDB) (<a href="Rummage v0.0.1 released – a Clojure client library for Amazon’s SimpleDB (SDB)">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- SimpleDB is a relational DB offered by Amazon. Cemerick wrote a new library based on an existing one (initiated by Rich Hickey himself), given that the latter had some design issues and lacked some features that the author needed.</li>
	<li>Backtype, a #clojure startup raise 1m (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/10/social-analytics-platform-backtype-raises-a-cool-million-in-funding/">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- What's more interesting is that backtype is not shy to mention that pretty much all their code is cloure :). They have also produced some open source clojure projects like <a href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog">cascalog</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/elephantdb">elephantDB</a></li>
