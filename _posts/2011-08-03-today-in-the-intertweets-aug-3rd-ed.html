<ul>
	<li>Installed elein for the first time today: elein-reswank is a life-saver. (<a href="http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/elein">here</a>, via @semperos) -- That's a nice treat (if you're using Emacs, that is). An Emacs package that let's you easily run leiningen tasks.</li>
	<li>learned a new trick at #jrubyconf.. got some clojure in my ruby - how awesome is that! (<a href="https://gist.github.com/1122731">here</a>, via @igrigorik) -- What's all that code without parentheses?! Argh, my eyes!! (joking, in case that wasn't clear)</li>
	<li>Getting started with #Clojure in 3 Minutes (<a href="http://charlie.griefer.com/blog/2011/08/03/clojure-in-3-minutes/">here</a>, via @charliegriefer) -- We're now down to 3 minutes? Not bad. But that's not fair because it's using Leiningen; some of us had to manually compile clojure and then transcribe it to JVM-bytecode punchcards, ya know?</li>
	<li>Playing around with a toy type checker with #clojure #logic (<a href="https://gist.github.com/1123268">here</a>, via @ambrosebs) -- I think I like this new trend of announcing projects via gisting some code...</li>
	<li>#clojure @unclebobmartin: "Functional languages are in the ascendancy, and Clojure is the best of the current batch" (<a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1743276">here</a>, via @jmeydam) -- This is an interview belonging to a series on the 10th anniversary of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>, of which Robert Marting (a.k.a. Uncle Bob) was one of the signers. In the same series there is also <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1739477">an interview with Brian Marick</a>, another of the manifesto signers, now a clojurian (amongst other things) and author of <a href="https://github.com/marick/Midje">Midje</a>, a testing framework for Clojure.</li>
