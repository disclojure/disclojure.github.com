<ul>
	<li>Some thoughts I have on functional programming languages (clojure and scala) and Big Data (<a href="http://merrigrove.blogspot.com/2010/12/based-on-true-story-functional.html">here</a>, via @ReverendTopo) -- This is a very interesting read that provides a high-level introduction to Big Data and its tools, and continues to provide the thesis that functional languages are the best fit for getting work done in this environment. The argument is mainly that with functional languages complex queries can be expressed nicely in the host language, as opposed to having to use cumbersome and awkward libraries or a having to use DSLs (read SQL) that are completely disconnected form the host language in which they're going to be used. The author takes a look at both Haskell-style languages and Lispy ones, while mentioning that the existence of macros in some of the lispy languages give them a leg up in this area. Great read!</li>
	<li>What are alternatives to JVM exceptions for reporting and handling errors in clojure code? (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4522443/what-are-alternatives-to-jvm-exceptions-for-reporting-and-handling-errors-in-cloj">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- This is a pet peeve of mine. It turns out that recently there has been some activity around this topic, including also the need to have unified solution for this issue (currently there are 3 libraries aiming at this same problem), and a proposal is being put together (<a href="http://dev.clojure.org/display/design/Exception+Handling">here</a>, and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure-dev/browse_thread/thread/734ee59f6cbc1b55">here</a>)</li>
	<li>Leiningen ANTLR plugin published by my Revelytix colleague Alex Hall! (<a href="https://github.com/alexhall/lein-antlr">here</a>, via @puredanger) -- Process <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a> grammars from Leiningen.</li>
