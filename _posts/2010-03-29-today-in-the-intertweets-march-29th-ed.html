<ul>
	<li>#London #Clojure dojo tomorrow evening. (((((Emacs, recursion, confusion and pizza)))). See you there! (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/calendar/12574276/">here</a>, via @ntoll) -- I can't tell when or where because the meet-up is private :(</li>
	<li>A demo of @cgrand's Moustache Clojure web framework -- very nice. (<a href="http://gist.github.com/109955">here</a>, via @fogus) -- So the number of different web frameworks for clojure keeps growing. Interestingly enough though they are all inter-compatible in one way or another. Time to start talking of an ecosystem? This one is compatible with Ring and Compojure.</li>
	<li>Hmm.. (defn foo [q w e r t y u i o p a s d f g h j k l z x c]) =&gt; java.lang.Exception: Can't specify more than 20 params (via @nipra) -- is that so? Yes it is :( ... 'Hmm' indeed!</li>
	<li>I love the fact that I created a decent massively-parallel machine translator between 22 western languages in a weekend (via @leifwalsh) -- Now that is a teaser! Tell us more about it...</li>
	<li>Functional Fluid Dynamics In Clojure (<a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2010/03/functional-fluid-dynamics-in-clojure/">here</a>, via @LauJensen) -- This is an in depth article on how to write really fast clojure code with the help of a few tools (a benchmarking tool, a profiler, and clojure experts). Discovering where the clojure compiler is using Java reflection is key for making code work fast when interoperating with Plain Ol' Java. Oh, and you'll learn some Fluid Dynamics simulation along the way :)</li>
	<li>Clojure Web Development with Ring (<a href="http://mmcgrana.github.com/2010/03/clojure-web-development-ring.html">here</a>, via @mmcgrana) -- The author of <a href="http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring">Ring</a> writes this introduction to this web development framework, now in its version 0.2. This text is very approachable, so if you've never tried Ring before, now it is your time!</li>
	<li>I &lt;3 (swank.core/break), breakpoints for Clojure right in Emacs (via @swannodette) -- Wait! When did that happen? Oh, <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure/commit/63d9545a13b8e596f50160abe77c29b7bac1b00e">it happened today</a>.</li>
