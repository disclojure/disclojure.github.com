<ul>
	<li>Generic equation solver &amp; macros (<a href="http://vimeo.com/9666573">video</a> here, via @fulldisclojure) -- A new episode of the weekly series by Sean Devlin that expands on macro creation (he did an episode on simpler macros a couple of weeks ago). He's got some nice macro-fu going on there!</li>
	<li>Analyzing JVM performance is hard ...but Clojure hash-maps really are fast (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/776943086de213f9">here</a>, via @chrishouser) -- That's from Clojure's email list; someone posts a micro-benchmark comparing the performance hash-maps in Clojure and in Haskell. The conversation that follows shows once again that micro-benchmarks are almost always flawed and that, oh well, it is really hard to make fair comparisons.</li>
	<li>Clojure job market flys past Java's and Python's!!!1!!1! (<a href="http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=Java%2C+Python%2C+clojure&amp;l=&amp;relative=1">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- In RELATIVE terms, that is!</li>
	<li>I find this chart of Scala/Clojure/Erlang/Haskell/F#/Lisp jobs interesting (<a href="http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends?q=scala,+clojure,+erlang,+F%23,+Haskell,+Lisp">here</a>, via @puredanger) -- And Clojure is the one that has grown the fastest in the last 6 mo., again in relative terms. In absolute terms, it now seems to be on par with F# and getting close to Haskell and Erlang.</li>
	<li>A simple web interface to mongodb written in clojure (<a href="http://github.com/sethtrain/humongous">here</a>, via @sethtrain)</li>
	<li>Graph Reasoner for Clojure (<a href="http://www.lispcast.com/projects/graph-reasoner-for-clojure/">here</a>, via @ml_bot) -- Graph reasoning is a way to do inference over a relationship graph.</li>
	<li>Generating deftype forms in macros (<a href="http://onclojure.com/2010/02/23/generating-deftype-forms-in-macros/">here</a>, via @jneira) -- When trying to write macros that generate deftypes, you will find that the standard behavior of syntax-quote might not work too well because it tries to resolve unqualified symbols to their namespace-qualified equivalents. Int this article, an alternative for syntax-quote is proposed for things like deftype.</li>
	<li>Clojure, Haskell &amp; Ruby Vs Euler 25 (<a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2010/02/haskell-ruby-clojure/">here</a>, via @fulldisclojure) -- Speaking of micr0-benchmarks, here is a new article from Lau Jensen comparing Clojure, Scala and Haskell. Needless to day this micro-benchmark raises some discussion. His results? Clojure has the most compact implementation and Haskell is absolutely fast.</li>
</ul>
