<ul>
	<li>A bug-fixing genetic program written in Clojure that operates directly on ASM (awesome!) (<a href="http://genprog.adaptive.cs.unm.edu/asm/about.html">here</a>, via @jbrownlee) -- You need the program executable, a set of successful positive tests, and a failing test, and this <a href="http://genprog.adaptive.cs.unm.edu/asm/code.html">program written in Clojure</a> will fix your executable.</li>
	<li>My yet-another-Clojure-SQL-lib, oyako (<a href="http://github.com/briancarper/oyako">here</a>, via @BrianCarper)</li>

First you define the contracts as a higher-order function, and then you apply the contract to existing functions via a partial application. <a href="http://github.com/fogus/trammel">Work in progress</a>.</li>
	<li>Just Published: Practical Clojure (<a href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/1430272317">here</a>, via @ApressBooks) -- This book is by Luke Van der Hart and it is an introduction to Clojure. 232 pages.</li>
