<ul>
	<li>Weigh in on the future of M-x swank-clojure-project (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/swank-clojure/browse_thread/thread/e6656cc66c5ac15f">here</a>, via @technomancy) -- This only affects you if you are using Emacs and Clojure via Slime/Swank. If you are using swank-clojure-project to fire off your Clojure REPL, know that maintaining that piece of code is cumbersome and slows down the addition of new features to Swank. Since there are alternative ways to running Swank (namely, from maven or from Leningen), there is talk about removing swank-clojure-project altogether. Chime in with if you want swank-clojure-project to stay.</li>
	<li>Shell Scripting in Clojure with Pallet (<a href="http://hugoduncan.org/post/2010/shell_scripting_in_clojure_with_pallet.xhtml">here</a>, via @jneira) -- With @hugoduncan'sÂ <a href="http://github.com/hugoduncan/pallet">Pallet</a> you can write shell scripts in Clojure that will result in actual shell scripts, with all the Clojure functional approach. Pallet does the heavy lifting for you!
<ul>
	<li>new #cloud provisioning tool pallet is the most watched #clojure project on #github today! congrats @hugoduncan (<a href="http://github.com/languages/Clojure">here</a>, via @jclouds)</li>

	<li>Clojure data structures will properly support Java serialization in v1.2 (<a href="http://github.com/richhickey/clojure/commit/68a14c88d11555353bb471efd94ba7d40c2d5008">here</a>, via @cemerick)</li>
	<li>*Another* Pragmatic Studio Clojure session in Reston, VA in September. (<a href="http://pragmaticstudio.com/clojure">here</a>, via @fogus) -- May 12-14 is sold out. Next one is September 13-15</li>
	<li>#clojure 1.2 release plan (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/21f9dbb6c6ee5196">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- In short, if all goes well, it could be 4 to 6 weeks away.</li>
	<li>"Practical #Clojure" by me &amp; Luke VanderHart in final edits! 12 chaps available in alpha (<a href="http://apress.com/book/view/9781430272311">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- The race to publish the next Clojure book is tight!</li>
	<li>Your Build, Lava Lamps and Clojure (<a href="http://weakreference.blogspot.com/2010/05/your-build-lava-lamps-and-clojure.html">here</a>, via @weakreference) -- Clojure code to poll the RSS feeds of your Continuous Integration server and controls the Lava Lamp depending on wether the builds are successful or not. Sounds like a fun project!</li>
