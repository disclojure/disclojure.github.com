<ul>
	<li>How should Clojure applications be structured? (<a href="http://cemerick.com/2011/01/13/how-should-clojure-applications-be-structured/">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- That is a very good question.</li>
	<li>Counterclockwise (clojure eclipse plugin) 0.2.0 RC4 out ! Help us, test it and give feedback! (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojuredev-users/browse_thread/thread/5ae156a4fcd03df9">here</a>, via @petitlaurent) -- And what happened to RC2 and RC3 you ask? Well, sorry to say this, but they didn't make it... but RC4 did, so it is time for you to give it a try! Completion at the REPL, more structural edits and a more reliable editor are amongst the new features.</li>
	<li>My first blog this year. About #Clojure protocols (<a href="http://maurits.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/find-which-protocols-are-implemented-by-a-clojure-datatype/">here</a>, via @mauritsrijk) -- This article contains some code to list the protocols that a datatype implements.</li>
	<li>enumeration-seq is a handy lil function in clojure core to know about. turns any Enumeration into a seq (<a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojure-contrib/blob/master/modules/jar/src/main/clojure/clojure/contrib/jar.clj#L35">here</a>, via @alandipert) -- Argh! I could have used this one a few weeks ago!</li>
