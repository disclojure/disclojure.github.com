<ul>
	<li>OCI Software Engineering Tech Trends, Clojure Sequences, by Stephen Molitor (<a href="http://sett.ociweb.com/sett/settMay2011.html">here</a>, via @ObjectComputing) -- This is a fairly in depth article on Clojure's sequence abstraction and its uses.</li>
	<li>I love clojure, the language that can fit 5 sorting algorithms on a screen. (<a href="http://pepijndevos.nl/lazy-sorting">here</a>, via @pepijndevos) -- I counted more than five, and they still fit in one screen :). The article refers to 5 different lazy-sort algorithms that are interesting even though they are not extremely fast.</li>
	<li>A Very Gentle Introduction To Relational &amp; Functional Programming (<a href="https://github.com/swannodette/logic-tutorial">here</a>, via @jneira) -- David Nolen's logos has become <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.logic">clojure.core.logic</a> . What is it and what does it do? The answer, my friend, is in <a href="https://github.com/swannodette/logic-tutorial">this github project</a>.</li>
	<li>New blog post, Runtime Dynamism + Performance: Have Your Cake And Eat It Too (<a href="http://dosync.posterous.com/51626638">here</a>, via @swannodette) -- This article shows how clojure's type system can extend the host libraries (java in this case) to support new use cases, and even do it in a very efficient way. It does so by explaining how to add to all collections the ability to tell if they can be used as a sequence within clojure.</li>
