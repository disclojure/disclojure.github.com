<ul>
	<li>Here's my blog on using Clojure and the plaza library to muck about with RDF data from my #semtech demo yesterday (<a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/2010/06/24/using-clojure-and-clj-plaza-to-play-with-rdf-data/">here</a>, via @puredanger) -- This is an overview of how to handle semantic data in Clojure with <a href="http://antoniogarrote.github.com/clj-plaza/documentation/2010/05/05/rdf.html">clj-plaza</a>, a project created by Antonio Garrote. It contains a brief introduction to Clojure but that's because this blog post is from a presentation to a user group not knowledgeable in Clojure itself.</li>
	<li>Clojure simultaneously rescues lisp and the JVM. (via @arthuredelstein) -- 'nuff said.</li>
