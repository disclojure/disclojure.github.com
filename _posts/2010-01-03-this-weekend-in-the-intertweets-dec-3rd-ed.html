<ul>
	<li>blogjure is pretty clever: string template, clojure &amp; hibernate (<a href="http://bitbucket.org/kumarshantanu/blogjure/src/">here</a>, via @javame) -- Cool, another blogging system in clojure, it has also a neat  MVC implementation, but the Hibernate stuff is in Java.</li>
	<li>2 new posts on #Clojure + #Swing (<a href="http://stuartsierra.com/2010/01/02/first-steps-with-clojure-swing">here</a> and <a href="http://stuartsierra.com/2010/01/02/swing-into-actions-with-clojure">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- Titled "<a href="http://stuartsierra.com/2010/01/02/first-steps-with-clojure-swing">First Steps with Clojure &amp; Swing</a>" and "<a href="http://stuartsierra.com/2010/01/02/swing-into-actions-with-clojure">Swing into Actions with Clojure</a>", the articles are a gentle introduction to writing Swing applications with Clojure interactively in the REPL.</li>
	<li>Another post. I'm either on fire or really bored. #Clojure #Swing (<a href="http://stuartsierra.com/2010/01/03/doto-swing-with-clojure">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- This one titled "<a href="http://stuartsierra.com/2010/01/03/doto-swing-with-clojure">doto Swing with Clojure</a>" shows how using the 'doto' macro in Clojure simplifies immensely writing Swing applications. It also shows how to write a macro that will further simplify the creation of actions and the wiring of them with the listeners.</li>
	<li>obligatory Y combinator and fib in #clojure (<a href="http://gist.github.com/268082">here</a>, via @superpants5000) -- Not this "<a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>", but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_combinator#Y_combinator">this one</a>. Me? Still working the monads...</li>
	<li>Working with data sets in #Clojure with #Incanter and #MongoDB (<a href="http://incanter-blog.org/2010/01/03/datasets_mongodb/">here</a>, via @liebke) -- Ah! so many cool hash-tags in one single tweet! The post by the author of Incanter explains how the new dataset functionality recently added to Incanter works, and also shows how to use <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Home">MongoDB</a> as a backend data store for such datasets.</li>
	<li>Clojure and Compojure to the rescue, again (<a href="http://briancarper.net/blog/clojure-and-compojure-to-the-rescue-again">here</a>, via @antest) -- The author recently coded <a href="http://ffclassic.net/">a full website</a> using Clojure, Compojure and MySQL (and some JavaScript). In this article he shares some of the findings that he came across while building such site. It's pretty comprehensive and insightful, even if you are not thinking about building a website in Clojure.</li>
	<li>Gui REPL for Clojure (<a href="http://github.com/hiredman/Repl">here</a>, via @ajlopez) -- Sounds interesting. Screenshots anyone? Too early? Well, that's the Intertweets for you ;)</li>
	<li>defmulti and defmethod in #scala? (<a href="http://cleverlytitled.blogspot.com/2010/01/dynamic-dispatch-in-scala.html">here</a>, via @mitchblevins) -- The article goes on to explain the differences between method dispatching in Clojure and Scala, and how one would emulate Clojure's multimethods in Scala. IMHO this highlights the importance of having a language that can be extended in a way that is not awkward (i.e. via macros). Worth a read, and then go and <a href="http://clojure.org/funding">donate some more</a> to Rich Hickey's project since he is saving us from such pains...</li>
	<li>Working with Java Arrays - Clojure (<a href="http://ianp.org/2010/01/working-with-java-arrays/">here</a>, via @hkrnws) -- This article explains how to transform Clojure data structures into java arrays, showing how Clojure has already  pretty complex functions for the job that might not be all that well known.</li>
</ul>
