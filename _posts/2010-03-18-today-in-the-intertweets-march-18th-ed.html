Slow day today...
<ul>
	<li>Excellent post by @bradfordcross on big data (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/16/big-data-freedom/">here</a>, via @joealex) -- The article does not quite talk about Clojure, but Flightcaster uses clojure for their computations. Nevertheless, many folks use clojure for big data projects and this article is a good overview of what these folks are doing these days.</li>
	<li>Update supports Trace dialog for #Clojure to track invocations of #lisp functions in real time (via @MCLIDE) -- <a href="http://mclide.in-progress.com/">Mclide</a>'s support for clojure seems to be moving forward nicely.</li>
	<li>Google unironically shows me C++ job ads when I read mail from theÂ <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #000000; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" title="#clojure" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23clojure">#clojure</a>mailing list. (via @abscondment) -- :D</li>
</ul>
And that is all!
