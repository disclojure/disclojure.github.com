<ul>
	<li>clojure cookbook (<a href="http://www.gettingclojure.com/cookbook:clojure-cookbook">here</a>, via @piotrgega) -- gettingclojure.org gets a new section: a clojure cookbook modeled after the O'reilly cookbooks. Plenty of recipes for many common goals for clojure programmers.</li>
	<li>Domain Models - Thinking differently in Scala &amp; Clojure (<a href="http://debasishg.blogspot.com/2010/09/domain-models-thinking-differently-in.html">here</a>, via @debasishg) -- The author creates models for the same domain both in Scala and Clojure. It turns out that the programming language you use affects the way you think about problems.</li>
	<li>Introdução ao Clojure (<a href="http://www.diullei.com/?p=245">here</a>, via @diullei) -- An introduction to Clojure in Portuguese, but instead of using that Oracle JVM, it is using the Microsoft CLR. And oh, winforms!</li>
	<li>I've written midje-mode, a go at applying the "work with ease" mantra to #clojure/#midje development (<a href="http://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki">here</a>, via @marick) -- Midje, a mock-oriented testing framework for Clojure just got Emacs support, a rite of passage for any clojure project to be taken seriously, or so it seems. The link is to a wiki site, and somewhere in there <a href="http://github.com/marick/Midje/raw/master/videos/midje-mode.mov">there is a screen cast showing midje-mode</a>.</li>
	<li>Unifycle: A Unification Library for Clojure (<a href="http://fogus.me/fun/unifycle/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2010/09/27/unifycle-a-unification-library-for-clojure/">here</a>, via @fogus) -- "Unification forms the basis of Prolog’s modus operandi and is often used in applications pertaining to automated reasoning, logic, type systems, and algebra." 'nuff said!  The code can be found <a href="http://github.com/fogus/unifycle">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Classification with MIRA in Clojure (<a href="http://aria42.com/blog/?p=216">here</a>, via @aria42) -- Warning, very nerdy machine learning algorithm ahead. This article describes <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.61.5120&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">MIRA</a> and its implementation in Clojure.</li>
	<li>Notes from last week's Clojure meetup w/ Rich Hickey (<a href="http://combinate.us/clojure/2010/09/27/clojure/">here</a>, via @tvachon) -- Yes, your clojure code is about to get much faster, and with very little changes to your code to boot. I can personally certify the accuracy of this article, since I was at that talk too. Rich Hickey just gets better and better at this sort of talks.</li>
	<li>Hey @kennedywm, is your #clojure #VS2010 plug-in somewhere available? I would like to try it! (via @urzidlo) -- Another sign that Clojure on the CLR (.NET) is getting some serious traction: a Visual Studio plugin!</li>
	<li>Finished a braindump of nREPL's protocol and message "spec". Comments welcome, esp. from Clojure toolmakers. (<a href="http://github.com/cemerick/nREPL">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- An early implementation of nREPL, a remote REPL implementation to unify development tool access to the REPL in a way that is not SLIME/swank. This project is moving really fast.</li>
