<ul>
	<li>Updated JavaFX with Alternative Languages Talk from #Jazoon... covers GroovyFX by Jim Clark (here, via @steveonjava) -- If you are interested in how <a href="http://javafx.com">JavaFX</a> looks when used from Clojure, these slides show some code.</li>
	<li>Clojure/core Reading List: Rationale, tutorials, resources (<a href="http://clojure.com/reading.html">here</a>, via @hnfirehose) -- If you can't find enough links to interesting clojure articles on disclojure, you can always go and check this list prepared by the guys at Clojure/core.</li>
	<li>The Joy of Clojure is coming shortly in ePub and Kindle formats. (via @ManningBooks) -- Now with more JOY! At least for the ones that posses an eBook reader. And when they they said shortly they really meant in a couple of hours, because the ebooks are already available.</li>
	<li>if a Hindley-Milner type checker for Clojure ends up being more than 800-1000 lines of core.logic I'll be very, very surprised. (via @swannodette) -- You're now on record. Now you have to build it. I want it.</li>
	<li>(with-training Clojure/conj) (<a href="http://clojure-conj.org/training">here</a>, via @hntweets) -- What's better than 3 days of clojure at the conj? 6 days of clojure!. The Clojure/core guys will provide 3 days of training, right before the conference.</li>
