(Somebody --me-- forgot to click "publish" on this post from last week..., so here it goes, with a few days of delay)
<ul>
	<li>Pump, a nice abstraction over HTTP inspired by Clojure's ring (<a href="http://adeel.github.com/pump/">here</a>, via @ghoseb) -- And <a href="https://github.com/mmcgrana/ring">Ring</a> in turn is "inspired by Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack". Ideas are best if they're promiscuous!</li>
	<li>Clojure overcomes Scala in growth, LinkedIn says (<a href="http://twitpic.com/5wm2ux">here</a>, via @skuro) -- Impressive if it is true, but we still don't know how those numbers are computed and from what kind of data.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/skills/">linkedin.com/skills</a> is an interesting destination. Suggests clojure is the 19th fastest growing skill, and (about time) Java has -ve growth (<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/skills/">here</a>, via @dnene) -- This is where the previous graph comes from.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Note to microbenchmarkers: HotSpot profiles 10k calls before optimizing a method -@headius #OSCON (via @stuartiserra) -- So don't forget to run your microbenchmarks at least 10k times, and then measure the next run. Now, how does this work with JavaScript?, because this has become pretty relevant now...</li>
	<li>Information is best recalled when in the mental state in which you acquired it. I can now only program #clojure when drunk. (via @mcsnootch) -- Funny, because I learned and I code Clojure while being sober, and the output still looks like it's the one from a drunk.</li>
	<li>“@InfoQ: Adrian Cole announces JClouds 1.0 release” &lt;-- revamped Clojure APIs (<a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/07/jclouds_release_1_0">here</a>, via @disclojure) -- It's always nice when someone helps put Clojure in relevant outlets like InfoQ. <a href="http://jclouds.org">JClouds</a> --that now has now two different Clojure APIs-- abstracts away the details of operating against a cloud provider.</li>
</ul>
