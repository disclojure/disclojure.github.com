<ul>
	<li>I think this will be my next read: "The Land Of Lisp". See the music video (<a href="http://landoflisp.com/">here</a>, via @antoniovieiro) -- Here's a novel way of learning lisp, by building games. And here is a novel way to promote a book, by making a music video! The book looks very promising...</li>
	<li>Earlier 2day I articulated my best effort estimate of adopting clojure. Extra 2-3 months of learning time with a breakeven of &lt; 18 mths YMMV (via @dnene) -- Anyone has actually done this an can confirm the estimage?</li>
	<li>"The in-depth discussions left me both depleted and full of ideas." â€”Rich Hickey (<a href="http://clojure.blogspot.com/2010/10/conj.html">here</a>, via @willf) -- Rich Hickey puts in writing his thoughts about clojure-conj.</li>
	<li>Clamq, Clojure JMS Adapter (including support for ActiveMQ) (<a href="http://github.com/sbtourist/clamq">here</a>, via @sbtourist) -- The tweet says it all, a library to access JMS queues, for both consumers and producers of messages.</li>
