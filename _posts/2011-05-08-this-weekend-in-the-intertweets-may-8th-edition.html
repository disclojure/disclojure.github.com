NOTICE: disclojure will be taking a hiatus soon. A new baby will be joining my little family, just to spice it up a notch, and so I'll be hanging out at the local dive bar for a week. Kidding! Once the baby is born I will take some time to relax, change diapers and all that stuff that comes along with a having a new baby. I prepared a quick FAQ for the occasion:
<ol>
	<li>When is the hiatus starting? Ask the baby, not me. Soon, I guess.</li>
	<li>How long will the hiatus be? Probably a couple of weeks. No commitments though, I might be in denial.</li>
	<li>What should we do in the meantime? Abstain from releasing extremely cool stuff, publishing very interesting blog posts and so on. And please oh please, do not release Clojure 1.3!</li>
</ol>
End of Special Transmission. Regular programming follows:
<ul>
	<li>Adding sample output (JSON) page generated by #Clojure metrics tool to GitHub wiki (<a href="https://github.com/xebia/clj-metrics/wiki/Sample-output">here</a>, via @mauritsrijk) -- This is an output generated by <a href="https://github.com/xebia/clj-metrics">clj-metrics</a>, a tool that computes some statistics on your clojure code. Work in progress...</li>
	<li>A new blog post on dynamic classloading of Clojure code with ServiceLoader, that we used in #crazysnake (<a href="http://mattiasholmqvist.se/2011/05/loading-clojure-code-with-java-util-serviceloader/">here</a>, via @m_holmqvist) -- You can dynamically load classes by their type (as opposed to by name) if you use ServiceLoader. In the case of the author, they wanted to load all classes implementing a particular interface. As anything classloader-related in the JVM world, the devil is in the details. So this article provides those details.</li>
	<li>Interesting #clojure thought experiment: how would the last function you wrote benefit from turning all its arguments into functions? (via @craigandera) -- Hopefully not something like the Spring framework :/</li>
	<li>nREPL v0.0.5 released to maven central, now compatible with Clojure 1.3.0 alphas. (<a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- <a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl">nREPL</a> is a protocol (and an implementation on the server side) for remote connections to a clojure REPL, intended to be used by all kind of tools.</li>
	<li>CodeRay 1.0 will support a new language: Clojure! (thanks to @heinz_gies)Â (<a href="http://redmine.rubychan.de/projects/coderay/repository/entry/trunk/lib/coderay/scanners/clojure.rb">here</a>, via @murphy_karasu) -- <a href="http://coderay.rubychan.de/">CodeRay</a> is a syntax highlighter for Ruby.</li>
	<li>Force a #clojure #repl into your java application without modifying the source. Docs now demo using #spring ref app. (<a href="https://github.com/wirde/swank-inject">here</a>, via @jwirde) -- Swank-Inject lets you inject a swank server to any remote java application as long as it is running in debug mode.</li>
	<li>Using Clojure to visualize clusters built with Mahout's implementation of K-Means (<a href="http://antoniogarrote.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/visualizing-mahouts-output-with-clojure-and-incanter/">here</a>, via @antoniogarrote) -- There are so many cool projects involved in so little space in this post!</li>
</ul>
