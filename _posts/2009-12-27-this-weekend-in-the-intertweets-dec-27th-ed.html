<ul>
	<li>Seriously checking Clojure. To run it on Mac OSX SL use ClojureX. Makes it so easy (<a href="http://github.com/citizen428/ClojureX">here</a>, via @b0j3) -- I haven't tried it yet, but this is a set of scripts and configuration files that will help you quickly setup your clojure development environment on OSX. It will even setup both TextMate and Emacs for you :)</li>
	<li>clojure-maven-pluign 1.3.1 released - regression fix for compiling test classes in the testClasses directory (via @talios)</li>
	<li>Clojuresque 1.2.0 released! Not yet on Clojars due to 503 (<a href="http://kotka.de/blog/2009/12/Clojuresque_1.2.0_released.html">here</a>, via @kotarak) -- this new version of this Clojure plugin for <a href="http://www.gradle.org/">gradle</a> adds integration with <a href="http://hudson-ci.org/">Hudson</a> and <a href="http://clojars.org/">clojars.org</a> along with the possibility of disabling AOT compilation (now off by default.)</li>
	<li>How to install Swank/SLIME on a fresh Ubuntu (<a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2009/12/clojure-101-getting-clojure-slime-installed/">here</a>, via @LauJensen) -- Another screencast from <a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.php/blog/">Lau Jensen</a>, this time walking us through the steps necessary to have a shiny Emacs-based development environment installed on your Ubuntu box.</li>
	<li>Tutorial on Clojure language: templates and constraints (<a href="http://vimeo.com/channels/fulldisclojure">here</a>, via @hrjn_rss) -- More screencasts coming from Sean Devlin from the <a href="http://fulldisclojure.blogspot.com/">Full Disclojure blog</a> about the new features of Clojure 1.1. This time the tutorials are onÂ <a href="http://vimeo.com/8360422">templates</a> and <a href="http://vimeo.com/8399758">constraints</a> (pre and post conditions).</li>
	<li>Palindromes - Clojure vs. Common Lisp (<a href="http://jng.imagine27.com/articles/2009-12-25-174540_palindromes_clojure.html">here</a>, via @jng27) -- Performance comparison between Clojure and Common Lisp in which Common Lisp is 10x faster than Clojure. Apples to apples? It's hard to say, but CL seems faster</li>
	<li>Why Use Monads (<a href="http://intensivesystems.net/tutorials/why_monads.html">here</a>, via @ajlopez) -- Ever wondered why people try to understand monads until their brains hurt? Here are some reasons. This is yet another addition to the incredibly useful set of articles on monads in Clojure that Jim Duey from Intensyvesystems.com has put together (<a href="http://intensivesystems.net/tutorials/monads_101.html">here</a> and <a href="http://intensivesystems.net/tutorials/cont_m.html">here</a>)</li>
	<li>Melodic Clojure (<a href="http://www.logarithmic.net/pfh/blog/01261954121">here</a>, via @mmastrac) -- The author introduces a somewhat radical change in the way syntax of Clojure to make closing brackets easier. I will most definitely leave it up to you, the reader, to judge whether the code looks simpler to you, but the author has a reason for this, which he unveils at the end of the article. Most interesting is the fact that the author provides a modified version of Clojure that uses this new syntax! (or a patch if that is your thing)</li>
