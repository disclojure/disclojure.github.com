<ul>
	<li>Clojure turns two! (<a href="http://clojure.blogspot.com/2009/10/clojure-is-two.html">here</a>, via @ ... everyone!) -- Rich Hickey's celebratory post</li>
	<li>Now I get what the veterans in the "Coders at Work" book mean (<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=885709">here</a>, via @alenribic) -- how we might have just come full circle back to lisp</li>
	<li>La Clojure, the #intelliJ plugin for #clojure is available for community edition, moves to git://git.jetbrains.org/idea/clojure-plugin.git (via @wmacgyver) -- The plugin is already up in the plugin repository, so if you download ItelliJ Idea community edition, just go to the plugin section and search for clojure... and off you go! The REPL is fixed and works well now.</li>

	<li>Statistical Learning in Clojure Part 1: LDA &amp; QDA Classifiers (<a href="http://incanter.wordpress.com/2009/10/18/lda-qda/">here</a>, via @liebke) -- An in-deep article on how to write classifiers and train them following the teachings of the book <a href="http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/">"The Elements of Statistical Learning"</a> (which happens to be available for free). You might have to dust up your Statistics and Probabilities knowledge to follow the article, but well worth it!</li>
	<li>Python vs Clojure: Reloaded, a friendly apples-2-apples followup (<a href="http://blog.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2009/10/python-vs-clojure-reloaded/">here</a>, via @laujensen) -- Lau seems to be like creating trouble, so this article further compares Python and Clojure, this time trying to make a fairer comparison. Worth the read (Edit: I don't think you can compare two programming languages without creating some kind of trouble, so kudos to Lau for not backing out when Python practitioners get upset)</li>
	<li>Java frameworks that rely on method annotations exclude themselves from alternate jvm langs like #jruby and #clojure. (via @dysinger) -- good point indeed</li>
	<li>To start a REPL in any running #clojure process (<a href="http://github.com/djpowell/liverepl">here</a>, via @wmacgyver)</li>
	<li>The differences between 'concat' and 'into' (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/6a7f8e5989352924">here</a>, via @jneira)</li>
</ul>
