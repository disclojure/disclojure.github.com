  I got to interview @hlship about Tapestry, Java and #Clojure at QCon
  SF. Video is now on InfoQ

 author: charleshumble
 comment: Talks a little bit about
  [cascade](https://github.com/hlship/cascade) and how it is porting
  the bits from [Apache Tapestry](http://tapestry.apache.org/) that
  make sense in clojure.

  dosync+: dosync with event listener

  This is an interesting macro that allows for hooking callbacks on a
  dosync that will get called when a start, retry and committed takes
  place.

  Let's make it rock! If you are working on tooling for clojure, head
  on to this mailing list. Surely there are other people and teams
  working on areas of your interest.

  If you don't know [Shen](http://shenlanguage.org/), go take a look,
  you won't regret it. Here is what they have to say:
  "Shen has one of the most powerful type systems within functional
  programming. Shen runs under a reduced instruction Lisp and is
  designed for portability. The word ‘Shen’ is Chinese for spirit and
  our motto reflects our desire to liberate our work to live under
  many platforms." 
  It looks like Shen is being ported to Clojure.

  You'll only be interested in it if you're using Emacs. This
  Leiningen plugin generates the TAGS file that Emacs will use to help
  you navigate your code.
