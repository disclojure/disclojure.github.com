	<li><a href="http://blog.johantibell.com/2011/08/results-from-state-of-haskell-2011.html">What language to replace Haskell ? OCaml Scala Erlang Clojure Python</a> (via @GabrielKast) -- This is the results of "The State of Haskell" survey, inspired by <a href="http://cemerick.com/2011/07/11/results-of-the-2011-state-of-clojure-survey/">@cemerick's initiative</a>. Good read. They'd rather use OCaml, Scala, and Erlang before Clojure if Haskell were to disappear.</li>
	<li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/compojure/Zn2L-rxKO9s/discussion">New #clojure #ring middlewares released handling req params and serializing response in a RESTful and extensible way</a> (via @nilsgrunwald) -- Takes care of serialization/deserialization and supports json, yaml and clojure (for ClojureScript clients)</li>
	<li><a href="http://dosync.posterous.com/object-oriented-macros">Object Oriented Macros</a> (via @HNTweets) -- I'd suggest that you <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2917238">read this first</a> and then go over the article, and then first you'll be like "Oh?!" and then "Ahh..." and finally, "Oooooh!".</li>
	<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/1165885">A Clojure map inside an atom is about 2x more efficient than a HashMap with a lock</a> (via @nathanmarz) -- With code to back the assertion.</li>
	<li><a href="http://cemerick.com/2011/06/10/clojure-programming-book-now-available/">Another Rough Cut of Clojure Programming has been "released"</a> (via @cemerick) -- don't have it yet? That's because it's not published yet, but you can get access to the book as it is being written via the <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/0636920013754/">Rough Cuts</a> program.</li>
	<li><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/clojure_conj/clojure-conj-speakers">Want to know what Clojure/conj speakers are tweeting about? A list, for your convenience</a> (via @clojure_conj)</li>
	<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/1167234">CLI structural form editor for #clojure, inspired by INTERLISP</a> (via @alandipert) -- Built using zippers, this is a very interesting structural editor. Go over to the gist and check out the editing session, it shows the power of zippers :). Inspired by <a href="http://larry.masinter.net/interlisp-ieee.pdf">Interlisp</a> (hey, did you know that 1981 was 30 years ago? Right, I also freaked out).</li>
