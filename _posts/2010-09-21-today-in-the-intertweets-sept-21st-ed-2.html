<ul>
	<li>Looks like link√∂ping has a clojure user group now! (<a href="http://raek.se/lcug/">here</a>, via @mikaelsundberg) -- That's in Sweden.</li>
	<li>"JavaFX can work with alternative languages on the VM such as JRuby, Clojure, Scala and Groovy" (<a href="http://java.dzone.com/articles/javafx-rebooted-roadmap">here</a>, via @rponte) -- Don't miss out <a href="http://jonathangiles.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/JavaFXYourWay.pdf">the slides</a> from the talk at JavaOne 2010 that this quote comes from, there's plenty of Clojure code.</li>
	<li>Very impressed with this little snippet, Programmatically Compiling Java Code Using Clojure from nakkaya.com (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2010/09/20/programmatically-compiling-java-code-using-clojure/">here</a>, via @xgavin) -- Holy cow! Compile and execute Java Code at the REPL, in just one line.</li>
	<li>Swapping words with synonyms (<a href="http://writequit.org/blog/?p=422">here</a>, via @thnetos) -- Another article about Natural Language Parsing, with a very cool example of its use. Grab a text in English, parse it and then substitute every word by one of its synonyms. The result reads quite a bit like lawyer-speak to me.</li>
