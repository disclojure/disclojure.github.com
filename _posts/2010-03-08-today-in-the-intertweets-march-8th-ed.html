<ul>
	<li>Handy #Clojure snippet for apply-ing Java methods (<a href="http://paste.lisp.org/display/67182">here</a>, via @citizen428) -- A rather old snippet from Rich Hickey himself that makes it easy to apply Java methods to objects.</li>
	<li>Whew, new blog post about my library: Natural Language Processing in #Clojure with clojure-opennlp (<a href="http://writequit.org/blog/?p=365">here</a>, via @thnetos) -- Grab a text, break it into sentences, parse the words and <a href="http://bulba.sdsu.edu/jeanette/thesis/PennTags.html">tag</a> them. It's that easy! Work in progress...</li>
	<li>@hugoduncan 's criterium is a pretty sweet start toward a fantastic benchmarking suite for clojure (<a href="http://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium">here</a>, via @bradfordcross) -- "Criterium measures the computation time of an expression. It is designed to address some of the pitfalls of benchmarking, and benchmarking on the JVM in particular."</li>
	<li>Wow! Latest Linux Journal has #clojure on cover &amp; Rich Hickey interview! (<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/on-newsstands">here</a>, via @sfraser)

	<li>Analyzing Word Frequencies with #Clojure, #Enlive and #Incanter by Ethan Fast (<a href="http://blog.ethanjfast.com/2010/03/analyzing-word-frequencies-with-clojure-enlive-and-incanter/">here</a>, via @liebke) -- Uses enlive to scrape a web page, count the words and show their frequencies graphically with Incanter.</li>
	<li>Discussing IoC in #clojure for our #Java friends (<a href="http://vimeo.com/9969396">here</a>, via @fulldisclojure) -- This episode of Full Disclojure's video series is very focused on Java developers who are interested in Clojure. It shows how easily one can do in Clojure what is known as Inversion of Control in the Java's world(and other imperative languages too).</li>
	<li>another html library emerges for #clojure benchmarks; that makes 3 (<a href="http://gist.github.com/326055">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- <a href="http://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">Hiccup</a> is the HTML generation library that James Reeves is extracting from <a href="http://github.com/weavejester/compojure">Compojure</a>. In this code snippet it shows that this library is very fast, close in speed to simple string concatenation.</li>
