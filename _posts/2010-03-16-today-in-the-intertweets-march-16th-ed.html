<ul>
	<li>I hope to see a bunch of new MEAP content for @fogus's "The Joy Of Clojure" any day now. Rumors suggest as many as 7 chapters total (via @chrishouser) -- Those rumors are quite credible, coming from one of the authors himself...</li>
	<li>Blogged about the available Clojure IDEs - The Grand Tour (<a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2010/03/clojure-ides-the-grand-tour-getting-started/">here</a>, via @LauJensen) -- So after all the chatter about the need of promote all the IDEs that work with Clojure, not only Emacs, Lau Jensen put together this Grand Tour to all the existing IDE options for Clojure. Judging by the amount of retweets it looks like this article was sorely needed.</li>
	<li>Here we go: #clojure memoize with protocol strategies (<a href="http://kotka.de/blog/2010/03/memoize_done_right.html#protocols">here</a>, via @kotarak) -- An update to the very recent article about the many different ways to implement memoize. This update includes a new version of the final solution implemented with protocols (you need Clojure 1.2 for that)</li>
	<li>Is glad he got a chance to buy Rich Hickey dinner: the very least I could do in return for creating #clojure (via @craigandera) -- and we are glad you're doing that!</li>
	<li>Updated #clojure #gradle blog post with clojuresque. This is my current setup, minus the mix groovy part (<a href="http://m.3wa.com/?p=464">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- After all this recent chatter discussing the pros and cons of Leiningen vs. Maven, let's not forget this very powerful alternative: <a href="http://www.gradle.org/">gradle</a>+<a href="http://bitbucket.org/kotarak/clojuresque/">clojuresque</a> (based on Groovy). In this article Mac shows his own <a href="http://bitbucket.org/kotarak/clojuresque/">clojuresque</a> build script.</li>
	<li>Hey folks - no #clojure episode this week. Day job too busy. Will resume 3/23. (via @fulldisclojure) -- Bummer! No screen cast from Full Disclojure this week! Luckily you can still watch the <a href="http://vimeo.com/videos/search:full%20disclojure">older ones</a>.</li>
</ul>
