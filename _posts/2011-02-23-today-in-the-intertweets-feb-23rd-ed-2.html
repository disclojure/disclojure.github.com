<ul>
	<li>Clojure Libraries webapp up. Needs a lot of work still but starting to come together. Not ready for use yet. (<a href="http://clojure-libraries.appspot.com/">here</a>, via @gstamp) -- A web application to keep track of clojure libraries. WIP and in alpha stage for now.</li>
	<li>Only now learned of "Scala levels". Seems like a sad (inevitable?) turn. Feeling re-vindicated in my bet on Clojure. (<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/8610">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- So at which level would a clojurian be allowed to use mutable state if Clojure had this layered system? what about macros? and anaphoric macros?</li>
	<li>Advice to a Newbie (<a href="http://www.learningclojure.com/2011/02/advice-to-newbie.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @yueliufeeds) -- This is an email to someone that wants to learn Clojure, and whose author decided to make public, in case you get asked this very same question. It basically goes like this: read <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP</a> thoroughly and do *all* the exercises, all of them, and then we can talk.</li>
	<li>Steps and Flows: Higher-order Composition for Clojure-Hadoop (here, via @planetclojure) -- This post is about the higher-level features that <a href="https://github.com/stuartsierra/clojure-hadoop">clojure-hadoop</a> is about to get. They focus mainly in setting up complex workflows.</li>
	<li>Clojure Toolbox (<a href="http://www.clojure-toolbox.com/">here</a>, via @ycombinatornews) -- It looks like today is the day to release web pages about clojure libraries. This one is not in alpha, but in beta, and it is curated by James Reeves, the author of Compojure.</li>
