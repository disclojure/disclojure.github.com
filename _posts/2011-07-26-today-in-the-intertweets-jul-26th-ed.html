<ul>
	<li>I reserved @ClojureScript and handed it off to Clojure/core. If you're interested follow the account and maybe they'll decide to tweet! (via @BenATkin) -- Ben, awesome! Clojure/core guys, good one! :D</li>
	<li>Reddit.clj, clojure for reddit (<a href="http://sunng.info/blog/2011/07/reddit-clj-clojure-wrapper-for-reddit-api/">here</a>, via@hnfirehose) -- Now you can procrastinate more efficiently (and concurrently) with <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> thanks to Clojure. This is a clojure lib for Reddit's API. Now watch the productivity of clojurians drop sharply...</li>
	<li>ClojureScript Brings Clojure To The Browser via Javascript (<a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/07/clojurescript">here</a>, via @InfoQ) -- This article appeared on <a href="http://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a> today and summarizes very well the launch of ClojureScript, with many links to useful resources.</li>
	<li>Rough version of @odersky's phone number coding problem in Ioke - inspired by Clojure version (<a href="https://gist.github.com/1107137">here</a>, via @olabini) -- I guess language authors are geeking out at the Emerging Langueges conference at OSCON?
<ul>
	<li>forgot the links to the phone number impls in #clojure &amp; #ioke .. (<a href="https://gist.github.com/1105563">here</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/1107137">here</a>, via @debasishg) -- And here is the context. All the solutions seem structurally similar. Don't know what Ioke is? <a href="http://ioke.org/">Here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Java, Scala, Pig, Clojure are the JVM languages used at Twitter by @stevej at #osconj (via @arungupta) -- I take the use of Clojure has to do with the aquisition of Backtype Â (cascalog guys) by Twitter? or is it an independent event?</li>
</ul>
