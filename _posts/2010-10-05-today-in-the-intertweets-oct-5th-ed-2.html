<ul>
	<li>Nice article on Clojure templating libraries by @glv (<a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/pdf/IC-Clojure_Templating_Libraries_Fleet_and_Enlive.pdf">here</a>, via @stilkov) -- This is a PDF of the article appeared in IEEE Computer Magazine, and talks about a few of the document templating options in Clojure: StringTemplate, fleet and Enlive.</li>
	<li>Entendendo Licen√ßas Open Source com Clojure (<a href="http://weblog.destaquenet.com/2010/10/05/entendendo-licencas-open-source-com-clojure/">original</a>, <a href="http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sl=pt&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://weblog.destaquenet.com/2010/10/05/entendendo-licencas-open-source-com-clojure/&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;twu=1&amp;usg=ALkJrhhX2xtQFESvZmJowN4-35mEBmEifA">English</a>, via @destaquenet_com) -- Recently <a href="http://licensator.appspot.com/">Licensator</a>, a site that helps you determine which one is the best open source license to use with your project, was launched. This site is built in clojure and runs on Google App Engine. This post explains the main algorithm behind it.</li>
	<li>JamesGosling: I can't bring myself to use Clojure because I used up my lifetime quota of parentheses on my PhD thesis #JAOO #goto (via @arthurgaudio) -- Ok... <a href="http://xkcd.com/297/">mandatory XKCD reference</a> for ya! We all wish you had run out of Checked Exceptions instead ;)
<ul>
	<li>Lots of thanks to @richhickey, @stuarthalloway, and Cliff Click for a great mini-conf at the JAOO. My head is still spinning! #jaoo #clojure (via @RoyDealSimon) -- Glad to see that Clojure was well represented! Hey guys, if you're still there, care to share some parentheses with good ol' Gosling? kthxbai.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Just how can you not puke at the sight of such a syntax? (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure#Examples">here</a>, via @rafbm) -- Actually you cannot not puke. Until today this was the very best kept secret; that most of us puke all the time while coding in Clojure, it's like we're pregnant or something. On the other side PHP --which you seem to fancy-- has some fine and exquisite syntax that seems to help with proper digestion.</li>
