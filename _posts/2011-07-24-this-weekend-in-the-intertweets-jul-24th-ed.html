<ul>
	<li>9 new tech sources: node.js, CSS, Apple iOS, Apple OSX, clojure, Emacs, Fossil, FTP &amp; jQuery (<a href="http://duckduckgo.com/tech.html">here</a>, via @duckduckgo) -- Duckduckgo.com has a specialized clojure search engine. Just try searching for any clojure function and notice it doesn't send you to richhichkey.clojure.com which contains outdated documentation, as Google does (and why is that site still alive anyway?) Oh, and Emacs too.</li>
	<li>Well, I'm exercising regularly, so what's wrong with reduce-ing in Clojure? :) (<a href="http://drknucklehead.wordpress.com/2011/07/22/in-clojure-its-all-about-reduction/">here</a>, via @DrKnucklehead) -- Reduce is very useful when you want to collect all the results of executing a function over a sequence.</li>
	<li>Clojure/core is proud to introduce #ClojureScript (<a href="http://clojure.com/blog/2011/07/22/introducing-clojurescript.html">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- This is the official announcement of ClojureScript, and contains a lot of meat, including the relationship with Google's Closure</li>
	<li>With #ClojureScript I can not use nothing but #Clojure in my apps! (<a href="http://wagjo.blogspot.com/2011/07/one-syntax-to-rule-them-all.html">here</a>, via @wagjo) -- For the author of this article, ClojureScript's birth marks the beginning of a dream come true: do everything in one language (from DB access, to XML, to web pages).</li>
	<li>Clojure to Javascript by example (check the "Translation" part) (<a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/master/devnotes/cljs.org">here</a>, via @FGRibreau) -- "Translations" refers to a table that shows the equivalence between clojure constructions and the translated JavaScript equivalent, so you can compile your clojure code by hand (I bet Rich Hickey did so himself a number of times)</li>
	<li>weekend project: Rage Viewer written in #clojure and #clojurescript (<a href="http://sunng.info:8080/rageviewer/index.html">here</a>, via @Sunng) -- A<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rage-comics#.Ti0EsnNk9LI"> Rage Comic </a>is a special form of coming in which a rage inducing event is explained. This project is just a viewer of such comic strips. The site does feel very fast indeed.</li>
	<li>Woo hoo!! Got #ClojureScript and #Clojure connected via #WebSocket! (via @neotyk) -- That didn't take long... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets">Websockets</a> is the browser technology that lets javascript apps to keep a two way communication with the server.
<ul>
	<li>It was a good day today. #Clojure #ClojureScript #WebSocket sneak pick is here. Next days documenting it. (<a href="http://ws-cljs.herokuapp.com/">here</a>, via @neotyk)</li>
</ul>
