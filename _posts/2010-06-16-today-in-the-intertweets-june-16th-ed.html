	<li>TDD in #clojure Part 2 (in which I recover from a stupid blunder) (<a href="http://www.exampler.com/blog/2010/06/16/tdd-in-clojure-part-2-in-which-i-recover-fairly-gracefully-from-a-stupid-decision/">here</a>, via @marick) -- This is a second installment in a series of articles about TDD in Clojure (<a href="http://www.exampler.com/blog/2010/06/10/tdd-in-clojure-a-sketch-part-1/">the first one is here</a>). In this article the author continues his TDD process until he hits a roadblock with his plan. To summarize, in Clojure you might have to think about data representation earlier than you would probably do with OO languages, where this representation is hidden away (and thus less of an issue when creating mocks)</li>
	<li>The beauty of letterpress and craft and old arts faithfully renewed (<a href="http://muckandbrass.com/web/display/~cemerick/2010/06/16/The+beauty+of+letterpress+and+craft+and+old+arts+faithfully+renewed?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- Very tangentially related to clojure, but the author reflects on why some of us are looking back at Lisp and thinking... those guys got it right.</li>
