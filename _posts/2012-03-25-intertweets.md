  "What's your favorite programming language?" Python:
  2943, Ruby: 1650, JavaScript: 1335, C:928, C#: 776, PHP: 618, Java:
  524, C++: 510, and then Clojure: 433. This is the Hacker
  News community, so this might not interpolable to larger audiences.

  New post. The Continuation Monad
 author: jimduey
 url: http://www.clojure.net/2012/03/24/Continuation-monad/
 comment: >
  "The continuation monad is probably the most powerful of the
  standard monads. (See here) But it is very difficult to acquire a
  mental model of how this monad works and how to use it because it
  involves two very abstract concepts; that of continuations and that
  of monads." Didn't this just pike your interest?
