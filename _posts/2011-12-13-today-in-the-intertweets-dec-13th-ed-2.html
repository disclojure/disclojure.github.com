With this concept, Bob Martin theorizes that we will (have to) move on from programming languages that are closely tied to computers to more abstract languages--like Clojure: "Itâ€™s a different mode of expression, and it makes you see concepts that are difficult, if not impossible, to conceive of in Java, or C". Interesting and thought provoking read. Must.</li>

It's just that no one had written the library yet.". Indeed. This is a draft of what an initial typing system would look for Clojure.</li>
