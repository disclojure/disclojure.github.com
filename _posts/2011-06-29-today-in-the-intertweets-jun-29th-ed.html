<ul>
	<li>Lacij - a graph visualization library for Clojure (<a href="https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dsjwfrk_1js9ptkcd&amp;pli=1">here</a>, via @hyone3) -- This is a graph library for clojure that produces SVG drawings. You can use it interactively at the REPL and works at a higher level than traditional SVG libraries. Includes layout managers too.</li>
	<li>Guide to Programming Clojure For Beginners (<a href="http://blackstag.com/blog.posting?id=5">here</a>, via @hnfirehose) -- This is a quite extensive intro to clojure, broken into 18 chapters (for now, more to come). Keep it around in case some friend asks you about Clojure.</li>
	<li>Working with Clojure (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wjlroe/5884828092/">here</a>, via @wjlroe) -- The stack trace doesn't fit in that large monitor in portrait mode. Guys, stop breaking your programs into many functions. Put all your code in one function and your stack traces will be shorter.</li>
	<li>My heart Clojure shirt just came in the mail! (<a href="http://twitpic.com/5iswkd">here</a>, via @carinmeier) -- That's cute. Can I get one?</li>
	<li>Ferret: An Experimental Clojure Compiler (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2011/06/29/ferret-an-experimental-clojure-compiler/">here</a>, via @condotti) -- So what would you do if you like programming <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> devices but you'd like to have those devices run Clojure? Well, that's irrelevant. What would Nurullah Akkaya do? Write his own Clojure-to-C++ compiler, of course, what a silly question!</li>
