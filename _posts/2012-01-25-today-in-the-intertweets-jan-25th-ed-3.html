	<li><a href="https://github.com/clojure-clutch/clutch">Use CouchDB like a Clojure collection: Clutch 0.3.1 SNAPSHOTs now available</a> (via @cemerick) -- This was talked about some time ago, so now it seems there is an implementation: when using these collections, you'll be interacting with CouchDB (Search for "Experimental" in the linked page). Some of the examples in the github README are hard to read due to github not properly rendering ascii code blocks, so<a href="https://gist.github.com/1485920"> use this as a guideline</a> (the REPL demo part).</li>
