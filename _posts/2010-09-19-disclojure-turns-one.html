A year ago today --actually, it was yesterday-- I posted the first intertweets article. I wanted to be part of the Clojure community and I didn't know where to start, so I started <a href="http://disclojure.org/2009/09/18/today-in-the-intertweets/">there</a>. 366 days later, 263 article later, the disclojure audience has grown dramatically. Â As a testament to this growth, suffice to say that I just bought my first Ferrari with the money from Google Ads and that I have put the some money down for a paradise island in the Caribbean,

Not really. I is actually much better: during this year I have met a lot of you guys, both virtually and also in person, and I can tell this is a happy, smart and engaging crowd. Just for this fact alone this project has already paid off handsomely, and I am looking forward to the future of Clojure and its awesome community.

This is to you guys!

Toni.
