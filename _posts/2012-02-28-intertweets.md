  cld, a Clojure library for determining the language of some given text
 author: cemerick

 comment: >
  Very neat. It wraps a library that will tell you in what language a
  text is written, or a list of the possible languages, and their
  probabilities.

  This interview is with one of the first heavy users of
  ClojureScript. You can learn about the issues they found and what
  they'd like to see done in the ClojureScript world.

  Racket Gin Rummy in ClojureScript
 author: disclojure

 comment: >
  This is a ClojureScript implementation of the Rummi card game that
  is [showcased](http://docs.racket-lang.org/games/ginrummy.html) in
  the [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/) (an awesome implementation of
  Scheme) documentation. The sources [are
  available](https://github.com/thegeez/cljs-gin) too. Very smooth
  animations!
