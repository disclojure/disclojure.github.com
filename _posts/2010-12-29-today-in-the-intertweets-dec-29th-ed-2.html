<ul>
	<li>Ray-Tracing in Clojure (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2010/12/26/ray-tracing-in-clojure/">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- A port of the ray-tracer that appears in Paul Graham's book "ANSI Common Lisp".</li>
	<li>Looks like LINQ support was just added to ClojureCLR (<a href="https://gist.github.com/758697">here</a>, via @mattpodwysocki) -- From the linked gist, it seems like there is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Integrated_Query">LINQ</a> support in Clojure CLR</li>
	<li>Hammock-Driven-Development cheat sheet (<a href="http://data-sorcery.org/2010/12/29/hammock-driven-dev/">here</a>, via @liebke) -- If you watched Rich Hickey's <a href="http://clojure.blip.tv/file/4457042/">talk at the conj</a> in which he exhorted all of us to think before coding, and proposed a method to do so, then you might find this excellent <a href="http://incanter.org/images/misc/hammock-driven-dev.png">cheat sheet</a> useful, if not funny :)</li>
	<li>Distinctive traits of functional programming languages (<a href="http://flyingfrogblog.blogspot.com/2010/12/distinctive-traits-of-functional.html">here</a>, via @jonharrop) -- You won't find those traits summarized more succinctly anywhere. Great conversation starter with other language geeks too!</li>
