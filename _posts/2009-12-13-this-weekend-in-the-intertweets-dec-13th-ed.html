<ul>
	<li>A swank-clojure patch for Windows (<a href="http://gist.github.com/254166">here</a>, via @jsamsa)</li>
	<li>Clojure vs Ruby &amp; Scala — Transient Newsgroups (<a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2009/12/clojure-vs-ruby-scala-transient-newsgroups/">here</a>, via @laujensen) -- "Recently I had the good pleasure of reading a <a href="http://blogs.sourceallies.com/2009/12/word-counts-example-in-ruby-and-scala/">blogpost</a> which demonstrated a fun exercise in both Ruby and Scala, namely scraping newsgroups. I had a look at both solutions and decided to roll one in Clojure as well [...]" . Lau shows some good use to the upcoming transients</li>
	<li>Note to #clojure people - AOTing your code really makes it a PITA for everyone else to use your library (via @dysinger) -- Word!
<ul>
	<li>I like the neotradition have shipping a slim jar (Clojure sources only) as well as AOT (via @hlship)</li>
	<li>My gripes with AOT abuse #clojure (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/6cef4fcf523f936">here</a>, via @dysinger)</li>
	<li>It would be nice if there was a compile-time flag to enable/disable AOT RT (via @liebke)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Requested App Engine feature: "Add support for native concurrency features of Clojure &amp; Scala" (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2498">here</a>, via @kevin_noonan) -- Wouldn't that be great if we were finally able to fully utilize clojure's power in Google App Engine...</li>
	<li>So I configure a build for #clojure-contrib compiled against clojure "new" and it's on maven repo also <a href="http://build.clojure.org">http://build.clojure.org</a> (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/e22d746bb7a038c9">here</a>, via @dsyinger) -- You'll need to use this version if you use the "new" branch of Clojure since the official clojure-contrib jar is ahead-of-time complied against the main branch.</li>
	<li>Uploaded an experimental build of #incanter, compiled with #clojure's new branch, to #clojars (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/incanter/browse_thread/thread/94b30744fee1095e">here</a>, via @liebke)</li>
	<li>Persistent Trees in git, Clojure and CouchDB: Data structure convergence (<a href="http://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2009/12/13/persistent-trees-in-git-clojure-and-couchdb-data-structure-convergence/">here</a>, via @eclipsesourceteam) -- It looks like the use of persistent data structures has become quite popular lately. Although with some differences between these projects, the pattern is definitely emerging.</li>
	<li>Clojure roundup: Flightcaster, Crane, Incanter, Leiningen (<a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/12/clojure-crane-incanter-leiningen">here</a>, via @bradfordcross) -- that's at <a href="http://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a></li>
	<li>Got distracted from my writeup to try some more IO tweaks. 8m4s on #Clojure Widefinder 2, finally catching up on OCaml. ;-) (via @atosborne) -- The Tim Bray's saga around Clojure continues and the plot thickens, now with @atosborne optimizing View Finder 2 on the same Niagra machine Tim is working on. It seems things are going pretty well and there might be a 5000 word blog post about the optimizations coming soon :)</li>
