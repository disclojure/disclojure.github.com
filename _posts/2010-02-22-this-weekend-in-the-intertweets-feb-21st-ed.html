<ul>
	<li>Overtone is a #Clojure based musical generation and manipulation system for live-coding and more (<a href="http://github.com/rosejn/overtone">here</a>, via @8quashes) -- Wraps <a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/">Super Collider</a></li>
	<li>Looking forward to the #clojure namespace management overhaul (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure-dev/browse_thread/thread/46559fd9eb127bdd">here</a>, via @RickMoynihan) -- There are a few proposals out there to tidy up a little bit the namespace management. :use is considered harmful as it imports by default all the symbols in the imported package. Here are discussed some of the proposed solutions.</li>
	<li>Software Transactional Memory in JRuby using Cloby (<a href="http://developer-in-test.blogspot.com/2010/02/software-transactional-memory-in-jruby.html">here</a>, via @sai_venkat) -- This is about using <a href="http://github.com/headius/cloby/">Cloby</a> (by @headius, of JRuby fame) that allows using Clojure's STM in Ruby.</li>
	<li>Byte-spec: a declarative DSL for reading and writing binary file formats in #Clojure (<a href="http://github.com/rosejn/byte-spec">here</a>, via @8quashes) -- Load and parse binary files the functional way.</li>
	<li>2nd draft of new #Clojure test framework (<a href="http://paste.lisp.org/display/95188#1">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- Stuart Sierra is working on a new testing framework for clojure. This new version is targeted at Clojure 1.2 as it uses some if its new features.</li>
	<li>Writeup about my #clojure RPG so far (with video) (<a href="http://briancarper.net/blog/making-an-rpg-in-clojure-part-one-of-many">here</a>, via @BrianCarper) -- Great post about Brian's experiences in writing this RPG game in Clojure. It covers concurrency, OpenGL and making things move smoothly. If there is anything that summarizes this post for me is the following: "Clojure is a mostly functional language, in the sense of strongly discouraging unnecessary use of mutable state, and this program is no different"</li>
	<li>Applescript with Clojure (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2010/02/21/applescript-with-clojure/">here</a>, via @bubbl) -- Title says it all. Â Now you can control your iTunes from Clojure (that is, if you own a Mac)</li>
	<li>Some reflections on my first few weeks of heavy Clojure usage (<a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/2010/02/21/clojure-experience/">here</a>, via @puredanger) -- Looks like we have another convert :) Main point? Can go from thoughts to code without having to create boilerplate code.</li>
	<li>creating a simple game in #clojure (<a href="http://ideolalia.com/creating-a-simple-game-in-clojure">here</a>, via @ztellman) -- Yet another game, this time using <a href="http://github.com/ztellman/penumbra">Penumbra</a> to create the OpenGL code. The article is from the author of Penumbra himself. This article describes the design of this Asteroids game in Clojure. A very nice read![vimeo 9629431]</li>
	<li>Notes on upcoming #compojure 0.4 (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/compojure/msg/519e8fd5cd76dacb">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- Summary: More reliance on Ring for all things HTTP (some features have been crossported from Compojure to Ring), some of the libraries (HTML, routing) have been pulled from Compojure into their own libraries, and a change of syntax in how Servlet data is obtained.</li>
	<li>join me... in the *future* (starting to build the pieces for a Clojure enterprise CMS) (<a href="http://github.com/acfoltzer/cljcr">here</a>, via @acfoltzer) -- A wrapper to JCR-283: Java Content Repository.</li>
