(via @cemerick) -- These clojure tweets are becoming class of their own :)</li>
	<li>"All your performance problems are cache misses" @rhickey last night at #clojure NYC (via @stuartsierra)</li>
	<li>best-selling early access book "The Joy of Clojure" is %35 off until April 21 using code taxday35 (<a href="http://www.manning.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=1111_221">here</a>, via @fogus) -- If you don't have it yet, now it is a good time to get it.</li>
	<li>T-6 days until RubyLearning's #clojure course. 430+ participants, 50+ countries. 40.3% Mac users, 34.5% Linux and 25.2% Windows (258 votes). (via @citizen428) -- 430+ is a BIG NUMBER. Congrats!</li>
	<li>Hmm, the name #nosql is established now, but still no #nojava for the movement to #scala or #clojure (or others). (via @themue) -- Oh, no! Let's not even get there! :(</li>
	<li>Using binding to mock out even “direct linked” functions in Clojure (<a href="http://blog.n01se.net/?p=134">here</a>, via @chrishouser) -- Bindings are frequently used for mocking some functions during testing. But when using some of the multithreading capabilities of Clojure (i.e. pmap vs. map) binding will not work as one might have expected. This article describes the problme and a solution to this problem (for 1.0 and 1.1)</li>
	<li>ClojureW -- a simple and easy way to start with Clojure now became cross-platform (<a href="http://bitbucket.org/kasim/clojurew">here</a>, via @ktuman) -- Now supports Windows, OS X and Linux. ClojureW is a preconfigured environment that helps newbies get started in Clojure.</li>
	<li>Lazytest slides from #Clojure NYC April 15 (<a href="http://stuartsierra.com/download/2010-04-15-lazytest-nyc.pdf">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- Code can be found <a href="http://github.com/stuartsierra/lazytest">here</a>. Lazytest is an innovative testing framework for clojure that supports lazy evaluation (amongst other many cool features). Work in progress.</li>
