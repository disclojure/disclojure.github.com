<ul>
	<li>Just released episode 5 on expression threading (<a href="http://vimeo.com/8474188">here</a>, via @fulldisclojure) -- Another great episode of this series of videos on the new features in Clojure 1.1. This one is about the '-&gt;' and '-&gt;&gt;' threading macros.</li>
	<li>I've just released FleetDB, a schema-free database implemented in Clojure and optimized for agile development : <a href="http://fleetdb.org">http://fleetdb.org</a> (<a href="http://fleetdb.org">here</a>, via @mmcgrana) -- Schema-free, in memory, declarative queries, JSON and a lot more goodies. The DB uses persistent data structures (a la Clojure) and hence reads can happen in parallel with writes. Writes are sequenced. Being a persistent data structure, once you get your version of the database, it will never change; this is therefore an interesting semantic difference with other more mainstream databases. Also provides an append-only log so you can rebuild the DB if the system fails. Can you say promising? I do :)</li>
	<li>cloduino - a Clojure API for the Firmata Protocol (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2010/01/03/clodiuno-a-clojure-api-for-the-firmata-protocol/">here</a>, via @grantmichaels) -- <a href="http://www.firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page">Firmata</a> is a protocol to control <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> devices (should I say contraptions?) via the serial protocol. Now you can control Arduino devices via Clojure :) by downloading cloudino from <a href="http://github.com/nakkaya/clodiuno">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Anatomy of a Flawed Clojure vs. Scala LOC Comparison (<a href="http://codemonkeyism.com/scala-vs-clojure-flawed-loc-comparison/">here</a>, via @codemonkeyism) -- This is a critique of @laujensen's "<a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2009/12/clojure-vs-ruby-scala-transient-newsgroups/">Clojure vs. Ruby &amp; Scala - Transient Newsgroups</a>"  article from last Dec 13rd, which has been heavily reposted lately. Lau's article provides a non-scientific comparison of the cited programming languages based three straightforward implementations of the same program in Clojure, Scala and Ruby. There are two main measures used for this comparison: performance and lines of code (LOC). This critique states that comparing LOC is dangerous, as it is difficult to make it so that the results are meaningful and agreeable, and that comparing performance on JVM languages is also a difficult task. Let's just say that the Scala camp was not happy with Lau's article being retweeted...</li>
	<li>Clojure is as impure as Scala is (<a href="http://debasishg.blogspot.com/2010/01/pragmatics-of-impurity.html">here</a>, via @jneira) -- this tweet refers to an article titled "Pragmatics of Impurity", by @debasishg, which discusses the design decisions that some programming language authors make in order to have their languages be efficient and also leverage some of the benefits of purely functional languages. A great read!</li>
	<li>Clojure Contrib 1.0.0 RC1 available (<a href="http://clojure-contrib.googlecode.com/files/clojure-contrib-1.0.0-RC1.zip">here</a>, via @fogus)</li>
