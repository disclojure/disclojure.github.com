<ul>
	<li>A case for symbol capture in #Clojure (<a href="http://blog.danieljanus.pl/clojure/symbol-capture.html">here</a>, via @nathell) -- Clojure protects by default macro authors from capturing a local symbol (i.e. the expanded macro contains a symbol that also exists in the calling environment). This potential capturing of a symbol is to be avoided in almost all situations, except in this example.</li>
	<li>Improved Clojure REPL syntax highlighting (<a href="http://gist.github.com/337280">here</a>, via @nipra) -- this is an evolution of an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2474804/is-there-a-colored-repl-for-clojure/2475243#2475243">initial version</a> at stackoverflow.com.</li>
	<li>Intro to #Clojure #cjug on 4/14/10 (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/cleveland-java/calendar/12849377/">here</a>, via @JavaUsers) -- If you are going to be around Cleveland, OH on April 14th and want to learn about clojure, you should go to the Cleveland Java Meetup (at 5.30pm)</li>
	<li>One of the best parts about Clojure is that its API has links to the source of the function. Here is <a href="http://github.com/richhickey/clojure/blob/49a7d6b8e14050a45df5332e768ba6647752215d/src/clj/clojure/core.clj#L2379">'number?'</a> ( via @peregrine) -- This is an often overlooked feature of clojure.org's website.</li>
	<li>Rich Hickey the creator of Clojure, talks to the participants of RubyLearning's free #Clojure Course (<a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/04/06/rich-hickey-talks-to-rubylearnings-clojure-course-participants/">here</a>, via @IndianGuru) -- Only in case you are new to Clojure.</li>
	<li>Scaling Clojure Web Apps with Google AppEngine (<a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/deadline-clojure-appengine">here</a>, via @infoq) -- An interview with Stefan Richter of <a href="http://www.freiheit.com/">freiheit.com</a>, the creators of <a href="https://the-deadline.appspot.com/login?continue=%2Flist%2F">TheDeadline</a>, a commercial clojure App on Google App Engine. Good information from their experiences with Clojure+GAE.</li>
	<li>SQL WHERE clauses in Clojure from S-Expressions (<a href="http://www.paullegato.com/blog/sql-where-clojure-s-expressions/">here</a>, via @pjlegato) -- The many ways in which you can write a WHERE clause in Clojure and have it transformed to valid SQL WHERE.</li>
