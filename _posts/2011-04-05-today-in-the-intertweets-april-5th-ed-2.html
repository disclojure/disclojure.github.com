<ul>
	<li>Interested in speaking at Clojure Conj 2011? Send in your talk submissions. Call for speakers is now open! (<a href="http://www.clojure-conj.org/">here</a>, via @clojure_conj) -- Notice that you are encouraged to submit not one talk, but two. And with great detail. Deadline is Aug 19th. Do it.
<ul>
	<li>The #CUFP 2011 Call for Presentations in on! (<a href="http://cufp.org/2011-call-presentations">here</a>, via @rickasaurus) -- Speaking of conferences, there is also "Commercial Users of Functional Programming" conference. Deadline is June 15th.</li>
</ul>

	<li>The Clojure Dynasty (<a href="http://uros.tumblr.com/post/4359350071/the-clojure-dynasty">here</a>, via @uros643) -- A couple of days ago we mentioned an article claiming that Clojure was bloated (compared to Common Lisp) based on the number of functions and variables defined (or some other counter). Then, <a href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=42">one of Clojure's biggest fans</a> <a href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=374">chimed in</a>. This article is a response to both of critiques contrasting Common Lisp's purity versus Clojure's practicality. But the old guard will never let it go.
<ul>
	<li>Emblogginated: #_(&lt; (count common-lisp) (count clojure)) (<a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2011/04/05/_-count-common-lisp-count-clojure/">here</a>, via @fogus) -- Some more on a similar note. Clojure has just the right number of abstractions, not more, not less.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Fixing The Inlining "Problem" in new languages on the #JVM (#JRuby, #Groovy, #Clojure, #Scala) (<a href="http://www.azulsystems.com/blog/cliff/2011-04-04-fixing-the-inlining-problem">here</a>, via @devstonez) -- Cliff Click outlines an issue with some programming patterns used by the new JVM languages and how this pattern really affects how the JVM's JIT (just in time compiler) can optimize the code. A change in how these patterns are implemented can bring peformance boosts of 10x.</li>
	<li>What the...? clojure.org domain is expired? (via @abhiomkar) -- <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/39adfb3ae7c4dab0">Nope</a>.</li>
	<li>Announcement: pretzel - clojure predicate functions (<a href="http://joost.zeekat.nl/2011/04/05/announcement-pretzel-clojure-predicate-functions/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- I like this one: (str/looks-like-phone? "+ (020) 213213-2323")Â  I wonder if it can answer something other than true/false, for example 'meh'. Pretty useful.</li>
</ul>
