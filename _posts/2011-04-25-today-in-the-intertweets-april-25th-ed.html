<ul>
	<li>When will swank-clojure get it's act together and talk to slime the same way as every other Lisp in the planet? (via @johnfredcee) -- Here is the standard Open Source response: when you contribute the code. Maybe?
<ul>
	<li>Clojure is getting proper debugging in Emacs via slime/swank thanks to @georgejahad : swank-cdt (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/3d2d98f69518e07b">here</a>, via @tbatchelli) -- (disclosure: that's me) Speaking of the devil (swank-clojure), George Jahad just pushed swank-clojure one step closer to what other lisps can get via Slime, except that this debugger also steps into Clojure's Java sources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Release the hounds! Slamhound blows your Clojure ns forms to bits and meticulously reconstructs them. (<a href="https://github.com/technomancy/slamhound">here</a>, via @technomancy) -- This tool, that nicely integrates with Lein and Emacs, will clean your namespace declarations, adding whatever :uses or :requires needed and removing the ones not needed.</li>
</ul>
