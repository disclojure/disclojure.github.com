<ul>
	<li>OH "I don't write web servers often, but when I do, I write them in Clojure." (via @mattc58) -- :D</li>
	<li>Visugit is a visualization tool for git repository, using Processing and Clojure. (<a href="https://github.com/hozumi/visugit">here</a>, via @fatrow) -- I can't really say I can make much sense of the posted screenshot, but it does look cool...</li>
	<li>It's official. Node.js has surpassed Clojure in popularity (<a href="http://arnorhs.com/2011/02/28/node-js-surpasses-clojure-in-popularity/">here</a>, via @arnorhs) -- This is a conclusion reached after looking at google trends (i.e. what people are searching via Google). Also, on other news, Justin Bieber is still way ahead of Node.js in terms of popularity. Should I then assume that we'll soon all be running servers written in Justin Bieber? No? Apples to apples, please!</li>
