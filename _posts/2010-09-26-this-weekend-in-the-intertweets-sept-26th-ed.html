<ul>
	<li>Clojure and Contrib 1.3.0-alpha1 released (via @stuartsierra) -- This is to match Clojure 1.3.0-alpha1
<ul>
	<li>OK clojure contrib 1.3.0-alpha1 is back up; try again; "complete" module still broken (via @stuartsierra) -- So it wasn't a smooth ride after all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>A week from today tickets will cost $249. buy today for $199 (<a href="http://clojure-conj.org/information">here</a>, via @clojure_conj) -- Hurry up! Make the decision to come and meet us all at the first clojure-conj and buy the tickets before they become more expensive (the hotel will likely get more expensive too!)</li>
	<li>Radio claimed "facetious" is only word with all vowels in aeiou order. Clojure disproves it (<a href="http://gist.github.com/595603">here</a>, via @sanityinc) -- A one-liner. Easy.</li>
	<li>The book on Clojure written in German has been published. Hurrah! (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/6051762fb181e898">here</a>, via @tbatchelli) -- Hurra indeed! Now if I only knew some German...</li>
	<li>26 snapshots later, here's Lazytest 1.0.0 (<a href="http://github.com/stuartsierra/lazytest">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- This is a new testing framework for clojure that has been fed all the experience that former c.c.test-is and later clojure.test provided over the last couple of years. It takes a behavioral approach this time.</li>
	<li>Clojure may not end up as the next dominant language on the JVM but it's ideals definitely will. (via @danielglauser) -- Word.</li>
	<li>compojure 0.5 released. Ring 0.3 and #clojure 1.2 upgrade, start using protocols. (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/compojure/browse_thread/thread/1227493e360edf4f">here</a>, via @wmacgyver)</li>
	<li>Graphics like it's 1979: How to get clojure to act like a ZX Spectrum (<a href="http://www.learningclojure.com/2010/09/graphics-like-its-1979-how-to-get.html">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- The author discusses how it is quite hard nowadays to do some computer graphics. Too much boiler plate required. Back in the day, you would turn on your ZX Spectrum and start plotting like it was going out of style. This article presents a simple graphics lib for clojure that will make plotting on the screen fun again!</li>
	<li>How reify works, and how to write a custom type (<a href="http://pepijndevos.nl/how-reify-works-and-how-to-write-a-custom-typ">here</a>, via @pepijndevos) -- What I find most interesting about this article is not the subject per se, although it is interesting in itself too, but that it is a testament of how the Clojure community really works. A must read for everyone IMHO.</li>
	<li>Just released #clojure #maven plugin 1.3.4 - should be hitting Maven Central ~midnight (via @talios) -- Midnight? Whose midnight? Yours? Mine? We live in a global village with not so global timezones ;)</li>
</ul>
