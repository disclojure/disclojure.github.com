<ul>
	<li>Progress of my new Clojure book: 62 page draft. (via @IORayne) -- A new book?!?! Which one?</li>
	<li>introducing lein-cdt: Clojure Debugging Toolkit for us lazy coders (<a href="https://github.com/travis/lein-cdt">here</a>, via @tvachon) -- Ah! Aren't we all lazy around here ( &lt;-- fantastic pun, did you get it?!?! <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ptitle0t9r68ih">Click here if you didn't</a>). A lein plugin that will make sure your code is run in debug mode so that you can use <a href="http://georgejahad.com/clojure/cdt.html">CDT</a> to debug it.</li>
	<li>So what are pods upcoming in a future #clojure version? (<a href="http://kotka.de/blog/2010/12/What_are_Pods.html">here</a>, via @kotarak) -- Ever heard about "pods" as an upcoming feature in clojure but do not know what they are? This article tries to summarize what is publicly know about them.</li>
	<li>Clojure-flavored, browser based Lisp "IDE" (here, via @hnfirehose) -- "Las3rfl let's you create, edit, save, fork and run code in your browser... <a href="https://github.com/aemoncannon/las3r">Las3r</a> is a lisp compiler for the AVM2 (aka the flash player). In spite of what the wiki says, in my opinion it's best described as Clojure circa 2008 minus the math stack and concurrency features." Check it out. It is pretty cool!</li>
	<li>My 3 day long dream has finally come to fruition. A Bejeweled playing bot in Clojure (<a href="http://ique.github.com/bebot/">here</a>, via @ique) -- Finally somebody did something useful with Clojure! :D.</li>
	<li>A Simple Forth Interpreter in Clojure (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2010/12/02/a-simple-forth-interpreter-in-clojure/">here</a>, via @yueliufeeds) -- Forth is a stack-based programming language, with no much syntax to speak of. This implementation is rather simplistic (i.e. no control structures), but the implementation is elegant.</li>
