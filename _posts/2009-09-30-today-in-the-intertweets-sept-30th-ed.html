Slow day today...
<ul>
	<li>It seems confirmed that there is a clojure book coming from Manning and by Amit Rathore, at least judging from this tweet from @amitrathore: "@jboner it's planned for next year, but the Manning beta book program MEAP release is planned for december-ish" (<a href="http://twitter.com/amitrathore/statuses/4508325339" target="_blank">here</a>). That makes two new Clojure books, the other one being the one published by Apress (<a href="http://www.apress.com/book/view/1430272317" target="_blank">here</a>) and authored by Luke VanderHart</li>

	<li>Another article on Monads and Clojure brought by <a href="http://learnclojure.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">learnclojure</a> (via @jneira,<a href="http://learnclojure.blogspot.com/2009/09/how-it-works-monad-im-currently-reading.html" target="_blank"> the article here</a>) . The blog provides very approachable articles</li>
      <li>A simple genetic algorithm in clojure <a href="http://github.com/yogthos/Clojure-Genetic-Algorithm-Example/blob/master/src/ga/main.clj">here</a> (via @hackerlinks) </li>
</ul>
