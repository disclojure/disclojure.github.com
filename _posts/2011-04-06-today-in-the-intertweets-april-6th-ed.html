<ul>
	<li>Geekiest thing I read all week: #haskell vs #scala vs #clojure vs #erlang (<a href="http://news.ycombinator.net/item?id=2414035">here</a>, via @BigThingist) -- This is an interesting writeup comparing the languages from a very pragmatic perspective.</li>
	<li>How dependant on Rich Hickey is Clojure? (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5566687/how-dependant-on-rich-hickey-is-clojure">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- This is a question posted on StackOverflow. Should we all chip in for a praetorian guard for him?</li>
	<li>Wrote a small #clojure client for @exceptional (with ring support) (<a href="https://github.com/zkim/clj-exceptional">here</a>, via @napple) -- <a href="http://www.getexceptional.com/">Exceptional</a> is a service that captures and manages errors in your web applications in a centralized place, in a format that makes it easy to track the issues and fix them. A ring handler will send your exceptions to Exceptional.</li>
	<li>defrecord improvements - feedback (<a href="http://david-mcneil.com/post/4403345585/defrecord-improvements-feedback">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- This is a thoughtful post regarding the<a href="http://clojure02.managed.contegix.com/display/design/defrecord+improvements"> proposed changes in clojure's defrecords</a>, which we reported on a few days ago.</li>
	<li>"Here Comes Clojure": A Clojure Talk in #Clojure... and vim <span>(<a href="http://blog.darevay.com/2011/04/here-comes-clojure-a-clojure-talk-in-clojure/">here</a>, via @darevay) -- Now this is a fun project. Write and run your presentations at the REPL. Not only you don't have to deal with PowerPoint/Keynote, but you don't have to leave your presentation to show some clojure code, since you are already at the REPL!
