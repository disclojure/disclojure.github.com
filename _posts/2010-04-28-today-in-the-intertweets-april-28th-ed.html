<ul>
	<li>Video-materials about Clojure (<a href="http://alexott.net/en/clojure/video.html">here</a>, via @alexott_en) -- Yesterday I wrote about the Russian version of this page with links to all sort of clojure-related videos. Alex Ott, as promised, posted an English version of this page.</li>
	<li>in cambridge and interested in #clojure or lisp? #camclj at the kingston arms 8pm tonight (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/camclj">here</a>, via @fmu) -- Â That's in Cambridge, UK. This might come a little late though.</li>
	<li>Performance characteristics of functions operating on different Clojure data structures (<a href="http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2010/04/clojure_performance_guarantees.html">here</a>, via @stilkov) -- A very helpful summary of the how each of Clojure's data structures perform in relation to the number of elements contained in them and the operation performed.</li>
	<li>Number of monads in Clojure 1.0: Zero. In 1.1: Zero. In 1.2: Zero. Monads are not idiomatic (via @stuarthalloway)</li>
	<li>ProtoTurtle gives a gentle introduction to Protocols in Clojure (<a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2010/04/prototurtle-the-tale-of-the-bleeding-turtle/">here</a>, via @LauJensen) -- A fun exercise that will help you solidify your knowledge of the new Protocols in Clojure; a knowledge, no doubt, acquired after watching <a href="http://vimeo.com/11236603">this recent and nice video</a> from @stuarthalloway)</li>
	<li>In two weeks time next #amsterdam #clojure meetup, that is Wed 12th of May. Proudly hosted by #sourcesense (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/amsterdam-clojurians">here</a>, via @neotyk)</li>
	<li>#clojure 1.2 gets some new seq fns! (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/6d2ad26fad6efbff">here</a>, via @stuarthalloway) -- group-by, flatten, partition-by, rand-elt, reductions, shuffle, frequencies and includes? have moved from clojure-contrib to clojure.core. Some saw their name also changed in this transition: rand-elt -&gt; rand-nth and includes? -&gt; seq-contains. This was to better reflect their applicability an their performance characteristics. Read all the rationale in the linked post. (Also, check out <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/5dde272506a09a25#">this post</a> for more info about what might be broken if you upgrade to the latest 1.2 build)</li>
	<li>#clojure philosophy: right data structure for the job via semantics. (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/163084bb949606b8">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- Interesting pointer to a mailing list entry by Rich Hickey summarizing the reason why not all data structure operations exists for all data structures. A hint? Performance; why would you want to perform an operation on a data structure that is very slow for such operation? Data structures matter. Consider their performance characteristics when choosing them.</li>
