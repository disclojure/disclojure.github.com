<ul>
	<li>Functional thinking: Thinking functionally, Part 1 (<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-ft1/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- Just be glad you don't have to write this kind of code...</li>
	<li>Clojure Atlas now available: "An experimental visualization of the Clojure language and its standard library" (<a href="http://cemerick.com/2011/05/03/clojure-atlas-now-available/">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- This is an interactive visualization tool for clojure libraries, with the outstanding quality that it is not just a mechanized extraction of metadata and dumping of it into the web, instead, it is properly curated.</li>
	<li>Growing so fond of #Clojure that I think of the parens giving my forms a nice hug. (via @carinmeier) -- Aaawww!</li>
	<li>I just uploaded a simple tic-tac-toe player in #clojure Simple but beautiful. (<a href="https://github.com/paraseba/tictactoe">here</a>, via @paraseba) --"It was created for a Clojure presentation, where the public knew nothing about Clojure. So, I'm using only the most basic parts of Clojure. It has no optimizations at all". This is a good learning/teaching tool.</li>
	<li>Cool. Clojure mode has been merged into the the #Ace project now (<a href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/tree/master/build/src">here</a>, via @carinmeier) --<a href="http://ace.ajax.org/">Ace</a> is an javascript/ajax-based test editor for the cloud, used amongst other by <a href="http://cloud9ide.com/">Cloud9</a>. Does this mean that soon we'll be able to edit our Clojure code directly from GitHub in the browser? I believe the clojure support for Ace was done as part of building <a href="http://4clojure.com">4clojure.com</a></li>
</ul>
