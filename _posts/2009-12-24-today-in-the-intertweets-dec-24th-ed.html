Predictably, the Intertweets went rather dormant given that half of the world is celebrating something (Christmas, Holidays, whatever you celebrate... if anything). There were still some things going on:
<ul>
	<li>Lord of the REPLs (<a href="http://lotrepls.appspot.com/">here</a>, via @ajlopez) -- A web-based REPL where you can run clojure code (and scheme, scala, groovy....)</li>
	<li>Ho Ho Huh? Was hoping to have @chrishouser's #Clojure book in my stocking, but found a horse apple instead. :-( (via @fogus) -- It looks like that book will not hit MEAP at manning.com until after Xmas ... :-( indeed!</li>
</ul>
That's all folks! Happy Holidays for those celebrating (I will). Tomorrow I'm off to putting on some more pounds and will open the presents with my very own family.
