	<li>Functional Data Structures in a Persistent Setting - Part 1 (<a href="http://debasishg.blogspot.com/2010/06/functional-data-structures-in.html">here</a>, via @ajlopez) -- This article by Debasish Ghosh covers two different but related areas. One is about which algorithms to chose for a particular data structure, given that different algorithms have different complexity patterns; do you want a predictable but slow algorithm or a fast but unpredictable one. Sometimes you just want the best overall complexity (amortized). Â The second part covers the complexity guarantees of persistent data structures and how it is sometimes hard to measure it (with an example).</li>
