	<li>Awesome! #gae bindings released for clojure (<a href="http://www.hackers-with-attitude.com/2010/05/dsl-to-access-google-app-engine.html">here</a>, via @arj03) -- So if you want to write apps for Google App Engine in clojure and you want to use Googles data store, you might want to take a look at this library. It has two parts: a data structure definition language (although Google's stores are schema-less, you still want to maintain a schema at the application level) and a query language. You can find the code <a href="http://github.com/smartrevolution/clj-gae-datastore">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Don't forget the Chicago Clojure Group welcomes Chris Houser May 19 (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Clojure/">here</a>, via @DocOnDev) -- so that, don't forget to go!</li>
	<li>You've heard about it, now read what the founder of #pallet says about #cloud provisioning in #clojure (<a href="http://hugoduncan.org/post/2010/provisioning_cloud_nodes_with_pallet.xhtml">here</a>, via @jclouds) -- <a href="http://github.com/hugoduncan/pallet">Pallet</a> lets you create and run Un*x scripts in Clojure. Very useful if you're going to be deploying applications in the cloud. This article is from it's author and it shows what it can do.</li>
