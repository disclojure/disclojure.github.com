<ul>
	<li>Now at clojure talk bij @mauritsrijk and @svdberg #jfall10 (via @hierynomus) -- Clojure was represented at <a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2010/">JFall 2010</a> in the Netherlands, and judging from the tweets, it was very well received. Good job guys!</li>
	<li>Which one has more parens, Java chaining or Clojure? Answer might surprise you! (vi a@robertrolandorg) -- And clojure was also represented at QCon in SF, and <a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2010/presentation/Clojure-Java+Interop%3A+A+Better+Java+than+Java">well represented at that</a>!</li>
	<li>Rich Hickey's talk in 'pencast' format : "Step Away From The Computer" from #clojureconj 2010 (<a href="http://www.livescribe.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/LDApp.woa/wa/MLSOverviewPage?sid=R4XrwCpdzj5m">here</a>, via @devn) -- In this talk Rich encouraged all of us to take time to think and let our brains process information (while sleeping, or just laying in a hammock). It was a very inspirational talk and while we're waiting for the videos of clojure-conj to come out, this audio recording will do!</li>
	<li>ClojureQL - Revolutions, blogged about the rewrite (<a href="http://bestinclass.dk/index.clj/2010/11/clojureql--revolutions.html">here</a>, via @LauJensen) -- ClojureQL is being rewritten from scratch after 2.5 years of existence. All the knowledge that its authors and users acquired during this time is used to build a better implementation, while also trimming down the functionality to provide a very tight and clojurey core.</li>
	<li>we got clojure 1.3 running in the same JVM as 1.2! (<a href="https://github.com/ninjudd/classlojure">here</a>, via @ninjudd) -- And with this, classlojure is announced! This library lets you easily create a classloader with an alternate classpath and evaluate clojure forms in it, and for example, use a different version of clojure.</li>
	<li>Implementation “inheritance” in clojure (<a href="http://david-mcneil.com/post/1475458103/implementation-inheritance-in-clojure">here</a>, via @david_mcneil) -- Ever wondered if you could 'subclass' a defrecord in clojure? Well, you can! This article shows you how.</li>
