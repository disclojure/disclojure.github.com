<ul>
	<li>stumbling towards the clojure api (a code example using de maybe monad and null safe operator .?.) (<a href="http://twoguysarguing.wordpress.com/2010/08/26/stumbling-towards-the-clojure-api/">here</a>, via @jneira) -- The many ways to deal with functions that can return a null value.</li>
	<li>I put together a small example of how to use the #websocket support in #aleph using #clojure (<a href="http://www.spyfoos.com/index.php/2010/08/27/a-simple-chat-app-using-aleph-websockets-and-clojure/">here</a>, via @maclausen) -- Don't you worry, you won't be reading much code as the code in this example is very succinct.</li>
	<li>Random thoughts on Clojure Protocols (<a href="http://debasishg.blogspot.com/2010/08/random-thoughts-on-clojure-protocols.html">here</a>, via @debasishg) -- This is a very informative article about what protocols in clojure are and are not, the latter part (what protocols are not) being most informative for all of you programming polyglots.</li>
	<li>Porting #clojure ants concurrency demo to #haskell (<a href="http://www.fatvat.co.uk/2010/08/ants-and-haskell.html">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- Here is a follow-up post, "<a href="http://www.fatvat.co.uk/2010/08/speeding-up-ants-program.html">Speeding up the Ants program</a>" which contains some interesting profiling info.</li>
	<li>lein-hadoop is now available on clojars.org. Contributions welcome! (<a href="http://github.com/ndimiduk/lein-hadoop">here</a>, via @xefyr) -- A leiningen plugin that lets you create hadoop-compatible jar files.</li>
	<li>The only real problem I have with Clojure is that after learning it, you never want to program in another language again (via @mauritsrijk) -- I know, it happens...</li>
	<li>Beware Choosing the Most Complex Tool for the Job (<a href="http://stuartsierra.com/2010/08/28/beware-choosing-the-most-complex-tool-for-the-job">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- A word of caution for those too eager to use the new 1.2 features (protocols, records) that could make your programs more complex and less flexible.</li>
	<li>static - static blog generator in #clojure (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2010/08/29/so-long-compojure-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/">here</a>, vi a@maclausen) -- Nurullah Akkaya moved his blog away from Compojure and into the static world by using only <a href="http://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">hiccup</a>. The code is <a href="http://github.com/nakkaya/static">here</a>.</li>
