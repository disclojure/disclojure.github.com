	<li>Der Screencast meines #clojure Vortrags in der #jugf ist hochgeladen. (<a href="http://kotka.blip.tv/">here</a>, via @kotarak) -- Meikel Brandmeyer talks about Cloujre for the Frankfurt Java Users Group, in German of course.</li>
	<li>Was annoyed with debugging let statements so wrote this... anyone know a better way? (<a href="http://blog.gaz-jones.com/post/3079754941/debugging-let-statements-in-clojure">here</a>, via @gar3thjon3s) -- This is an interesting one; knowing what your let binding are bound to is sometimes quite of a pain. In this article a solution is proposed, but clearly it is not too comprehensive (e.g. wouldn't quite work with destructuring, so the author asks if anyone knows a better alternative. I want to know too!</li>
