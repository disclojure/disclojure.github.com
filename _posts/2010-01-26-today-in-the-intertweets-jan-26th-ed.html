<ul>
	<li>Compile-time type-checking multimethods in #clojure (<a href="http://paste.lisp.org/display/93940">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- Performing type checking at compile time could potentially speedup multimethod calls and order of magnitude, but only when the correct type can be inferred.</li>
	<li>Lindenmayer system in Clojure (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2010/01/26/lindenmayer-system-in-clojure/">here</a>, via @swannodette) -- Nurullah Akkaya, that blogs under nakkaya.com is on a roll. Here is a new article on how to build <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindenmayer_system">Lindernmayer systems</a> in clojure. L-Systems can be used to create fractals. Somehow Nurullah makes difficult endeavours look simple!</li>
	<li>Thanks Clojure. Every other JVM Languaje now sucks (via @omargomez) -- Word!</li>

Aaaaaand... that's it for today. Unfortunately, there are a lot of tweets in Japanese that I have no way to understand :(  --&gt; Any Japanese speaking volunteer?

EDIT: So all the Japanese chatter was related to the fact that @stuarthalloway's book has been translated to Japanese and published on this day, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/4274067890">as evidenced by this Amazon.jp page</a>. The cover of the Japanese version of the book is <a href="http://ssl.ohmsha.co.jp/cgi-bin/menu.cgi?ISBN=978-4-274-06789-1">pretty nice</a> (thanks @atosborne and @fogus)
