<ul>
	<li>Destructuring examples (<a href="http://paste.lisp.org/display/97057">here</a>, via @nipra) -- De-structuring bindings are a very powerful tool in Clojure. Here are some examples of what can be done.</li>
	<li>Hey folks - Traveling to Canada for day job. This week's episode will air Thursday (via @fulldisclojure) -- So no screen cast until Thursday :)</li>
	<li>Clojure-style Agents in #akka (<a href="http://doc.akkasource.org/agents">here</a>, via @jboner) -- The cross-pollination between Scala and Clojure continues. Akka is an Actor framework for Scala that offers simple scalable and fault-tolerant remote actors. Actors are somewhat related to agents in Clojure. Simply put, you send messages to an Actor and you send update functions to an Agent. Both models serialize access to shared data. Now Akka provides Agent functionality inspired by Clojure.</li>
	<li>Working on Walton (<a href="http://github.com/defn/walton">here</a>, via @defn) -- Walton provides examples of function usage right at the REPL. Pretty useful for people without memory like myself!</li>
