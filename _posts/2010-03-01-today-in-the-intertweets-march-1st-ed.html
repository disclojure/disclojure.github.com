<ul>
	<li>Published (finally) a Clojure app to get twitts from your account and push them to MySQL database (<a href="http://www.b0j3.si/">here</a>, via @b0j3) -- An interesting (brave) way of this author to learn clojure, by building a twitter app and using a database. Whatever happened to SICP? The interesting thing for me is that the author is using yet another library to access twitter? How many are there?</li>
	<li>Again, another #clojure #wallpaper done in GIMP (no PS installed :/) (<a href="http://twitpic.com/160kmx">here</a>, via @dsp_) -- Don't click that link yet... read below first.
<ul>
	<li>Turns out that #clojure logo shouldn't be used in derivate works, deleting the wallpapers from twitpoic. (via @dsp_) -- Awwwwww!</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Look at my Software Transactional Memory implementation for Cocoa/Obj-C. Based on Clojure's. Still experimental (<a href="http://github.com/aramallo/CTKConcurrency">here</a>, via @aramallo) -- Rich Hickey is a trend-setter.</li>
	<li>Webjureなんてフレームワークもあるのか (<a href="http://github.com/tatut/Webjure">here</a>, via @bojovs) -- Webjure is yet another Clojure-based simple web framework.</li>
	<li>#circumspec #inferior-lisp #clojure and #slime (video) (<a href="http://vimeo.com/9770382">here</a>, via @stuarthalloway) -- This video is awesome in many ways. Shows a mini-browser that lets you use a web-browser to navigate your code dynamically. Shows a cool emacs configuration. Finally, it shows how <a href="http://github.com/stuarthalloway/circumspec/tree/d05bdc5fb6ccb088787b35628dde2f46c7e8cc8f">Circumspec</a> looks today. And it looks awesome :). Watch. It.</li>
	<li>Conjure 0.4がリリースされたらしい (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure-conjure/browse_thread/thread/9e4578bda97e3863">here</a>, via @bojovs) -- <a href="http://github.com/macourtney/Conjure">Conjure</a> (a Rails-like web framework for Clojure) 0.4 has been released.</li>
	<li>Would be really interested in seeing feedback on this musing about <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #43556b; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" title="#clojure" rel="nofollow" href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23clojure">#clojure</a>and dependency injection (<a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/2010/03/01/dependency-injection-clojure/">here</a>, via @puredanger) -- How to do dependency injection in Clojure (or is it needed at all?)</li>
	<li>Are you ready for a Bay Area Clojure Bootcamp? Cast your vote now! (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/polls/227717/">here</a>, via @disclojure) -- Amit Rathore, author of "Clojure in Action"  and founder of the BA-CUG is asking "How much would you pay to attend a day long Clojure boot-camp?". Go ahead and vote!</li>
	<li>Vote up, if you want to see how to use tools like #ant #clojure and #hadoop in the cloud (<a href="http://www.sfjava.org/ideas/127654/">here</a>, via @jclouds) -- Another pool: if you leave in or around San Francisco, you like Clojure and know that there are more clouds than the ones in the sky, you might want to vote for <a href="http://anyweight.blogspot.com/">JClouds</a> to present at the SFJUG (and then attend, of course!)</li>
	<li>Episode 13 is up - inferring information (<a href="http://vimeo.com/9843950">here</a>, via @fulldisclojure) -- This episode from @fulldisclojure is about writing an inference engine in clojure. Pretty intense.</li>
	<li>Clojure + Emacs (<a href="http://mdelaurentis.tumblr.com/post/421253627/clojure-emacs">here</a>, via @mdelaurentis) -- A compilation of ways to interact with the Clojure REPL from Emacs</li>
</ul>
