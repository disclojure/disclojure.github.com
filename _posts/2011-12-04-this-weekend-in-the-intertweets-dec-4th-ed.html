(Includes last Thursday)
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://codelesson.com/courses/view/introduction-to-clojure">Want to learn Clojure, online?</a> (via @cfbloggers) -- If you want to properly learn Clojure, Amit Rathore, the author of <a href="http://www.manning.com/rathore/">Clojure in Action</a> is running a <a href="http://codelesson.com/courses/view/introduction-to-clojure">6-week online course</a> at <a href="http://codelesson.com/">CodeLesson</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://technomancy.us/155">It's impressive to see how the @Clojure community is fighting NIH. And doing so with consideration and rigor.</a> (via @soyrochus) -- The tweet doesn't give away too much, but this is about <a href="https://github.com/flatland/cake">Cake</a> and <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a> merging into Leiningen 2.0. So you get to have your Cake and eat it too!</li>
	<li><a href="http://postposttechnical.com/2011/11/first-steps-with-clojure/">Emacs configuration for Clojure development</a> (via @FlorianScheel) -- Nice to see how easy has it gotten to get Emacs working with Clojure these days. In my days we had to code some elisp!</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/alexmiller/clojurewest-overview-12111">Clojure/West Overview (12/1/11) - slides from @puredanger from last night's Bay Area #Clojure meetup</a> (via @seancorfield) -- The conference is shaping pretty nicely and some info about keynotes and workshops is already published. (disclosure: I'll be helping with the logistics -- I sooooo wanted this to conference to happen -- and also teaching in the Pallet workshop)</li>
	<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/1428711">I have this working now: A single #Clojure test case running in the browser and on the server.</a> (via @brentonashworth) -- I wonder if this kind of experiment will end up bending the universe and providing some time travel opportunities... Some laws should not be broken, no?</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgsAztXDuH0">Uploaded screencast of interactively developing @cgrand's Conway's Life solution in Clojure</a> (via @puredanger) -- It's 3 minutes long only, and it is very interesting to watch. The referenced implementation by @cgrand is <a href="http://clj-me.cgrand.net/2011/08/19/conways-game-of-life/">here</a>.</li>
