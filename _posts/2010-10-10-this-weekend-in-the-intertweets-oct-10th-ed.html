	<li>Clojure na web - Compojure/Hiccup/Sandbar/Leiningen (<a href="http://codemountain.wordpress.com/2010/10/08/clojure-na-web-compojurehiccupsandbarleiningen/">here</a>, via @paulosuzart) -- If Portuguese is your thing, this is an article about building web applications with Clojure.</li>
	<li>Taking Uncle Bob to school - A few words on idiomatic Lisp/Clojure in the Orbit Sim by @unclebobmartin (<a href="http://bestinclass.dk/index.clj/2010/10/taking-uncle-bob-to-school.html">here</a>, via @LauJensen) -- Lau cleans Uncle Bob's Orbit code, making it more idiomatic. Bob Martin has been promoting Clojure in his keynotes, going as far as to saying that this language is the future.</li>
	<li>Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript and Clojure (<a href="http://dosync.posterous.com/30036733">here</a>, via @codechef) -- A first in a series of articles by David Nolen, in which he will explore the Object Orientation capabilities of both JavaScript and Clojure. This first installment talks about type information. Â <a href="http://dosync.posterous.com/beyond-javascript-prototype-chains">Here is a follow up</a> that covers prototype-based inheritance in JavaScript.</li>
	<li>Creating a Quadrotor autopilot with Clojure &amp; Flight Simulator (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2010/10/07/towards-a-clojure-autopilot-first-steps/">here</a>, via @hntweets) -- From the most creative clojure blogger, Nurullah Akkaya, here is an article about building a Quadrotor autopilot against a flight simulator instead of the real thing (those machines are not cheap, and bugs in the autopilot can be costly). Of course this is all in Clojure. This article covers the building of a proportional stabilizer.</li>
