<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Clojure+Contrib">New #Clojure Contrib</a> (via @stuartsierra) -- All the new modular clojure contrib projects in one place.</li>
	<li>In time for the Times Open talk, CoffeeScript just passed Clojure in language popularity on GitHub (sorry, @swannodette) ... next up: Scala. (via @jashkenas) -- <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a> suxx0r! Kidding. I really like CoffeeScript :)</li>
	<li>Interesting article I helped to review: "<a href="http://pupeno.com/2011/08/16/why-i-love-lisp/">Why I love Lisp</a>" by @pupeno (via @grrrisu) -- It is generally hard to explain to someone that never tried lisp why lisp is a different kind of language. This article does a very good job at it.</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.8thlight.com/steven-degutis/2011/08/15/future-of-lisp.html">Yay, #clojure</a> (via @yawmark) -- A well though out explanation of why so many are so excited about Clojure (spoiler: the JVM with its mature libs).</li>
	<li><span>Joy of #Clojure was a finalist for a Jolt award. We were up against some tough competition and <a href="http://drdobbs.com/joltawards/231500080?pgno=4">came up just short</a> :) (via @fogus) -- Not bad to be in the same ranking position with <a href="http://drdobbs.com/joltawards/231500080?pgno=3">Donald Knuth</a>! 99.99999999995% of the mortals will never get there... </span></li>
