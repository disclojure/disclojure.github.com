<ul>
	<li><a href="http://oblong-code.blogspot.com/2012/01/year-of-clojure.html">AÂ sweet blog on the challenges of developing games with Clojure</a> (via @swannodette) -- Not many people think of Clojure when deciding to write a computer game, but some do, and this article summarizes where Clojure falls short in as a gaming platform.</li>
	<li><a href="http://biesnecker.com/solving-pell-equations-chakravala-clojure.htmld">Solving Pell's equations with the Chakravala method and Clojure</a> (via @hnfirehose) -- Apparently solving some of the <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> problems is not a trivial task, and in this case it needed implementing an algorithm that is over 1000 years old. Older than LISP! Bonus: <a href="http://biesnecker.com/euler-clojure.html">more clojure solutions for Project Euler problems</a>.</li>
	<li>Just pushed the Swank Clojure 1.4.0 release with a stable CDT debugger and improved stack traces. Thanks to @tavisrudd and @georgejahad (via @technomancy) -- What this means is that Emacs gains an even better debugger if you're using swank-clojure (you probably are).</li>
	<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9051516/clojure-and-leiningen-using-a-git-repository-as-dependency">clojure and leiningen - using a git repository as dependency</a> (via @tobyhede) -- Now that's one little gem hidden in the goldmine that ClojureScript One is: declare git repos (and even the actual commit) as project dependencies. Why use a Maven repo when you can go straight to the source?!!?</li>
	<li><a href="http://clojurewest.org/news/2012/1/29/friend-of-attendee-program.html">Announcing the new Clojure/West "Friend of Attendee" program! You could get a discount or refund! </a>(via @ClojureWest) -- That's right, refer a friend to Clojure/West (or any other human I believe) and get a discount or a refund if you have already paid (as long as your 'friend' buys a ticket too)
<ul>
	<li>So far the company with the most developers attending Clojure/West is... Apple. Surprised? (via @ClojureWest) -- I am not going to lie: yes, surprised.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><a href="http://clj-me.cgrand.net/2012/01/30/the-reasoned-scheduler/">"The Reasoned Scheduler"</a> (via @cgrand) -- "<em>tl;dr How I realized that core.logic (or miniKanren) is essentially a scheduler."</em></li>
</ul>
