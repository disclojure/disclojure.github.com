	<li>Protocols are faster than Clojure multimethods. Can be as fast as direct func calls in fact and inlined by hotspot (via @chouser) -- This is an important fact.</li>
	<li>Clojure or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Parentheses (<a href="http://nathanmarz.com/blog/clojure-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-paren.html">here</a>, via @nathanmarz) -- This is an article that explains one of the main differences between Lisps and other mainstream languages: the ability to extend the the language --even create your own mini-languages-- to fit your purposes from within the host language itself and without adding any accidental complexity to the system.. Most other languages add accidental complexity when trying to do so.</li>
	<li>Sweet, a Clojure Ring adapter for Mongrel2 by mikejs (<a href="http://github.com/mikejs/ring/tree/master/ring-mongrel2-adapter/ ">here</a>, via @zedshaw) -- This allows you to run Ring/Compojure applications inside <a href="http://mongrel2.org/home">Mongrel2</a>, a cool new language agnostic web server.</li>
