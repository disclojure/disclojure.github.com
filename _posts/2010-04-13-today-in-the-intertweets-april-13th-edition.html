	<li>parallel k-means with clojure agents (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/adorepump/multicore-parallelization-in-clojure-a-case-study">here</a>, via @bradfordcross) -- Some folks at the University of Ulm, Germany, researched the use of Clojure for solving problems using parallel computation. They wanted to know if it would leverage the number of CPUs available in a computer. They used some Â machine learning algorithms for their tests and they provide this presentation as a result that contains loads of data from their tests. Summary: Clojure rocks (but you already knew that, right?)</li>
	<li>Adding LaTeX equations to #Incanter charts (<a href="http://data-sorcery.org/2010/04/14/latex/">here</a>, via @liebke) -- Incanter just keeps getting better and better. Now you can use Latex equations as annotations and subtitles in charts, which makes them look very even more professional now :)</li>
