<ul>
	<li>Learning about #clojure Pods, a possible new feature similar to transients but better, from Rich Hickey at #emerginglangs (via @disclojure) -- Yes, I was there. Rich Hickey presented his current work on Pods (previously named <a href="http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Cells">Cells</a>) at the <a href="http://emerginglangs.com/speakers/">Emerging Languages Camp</a> in Portland, OR. The room was packed with language developers and some 'tourists' (i.e. yours truly), and a total of 26 languages were discussed.
<ul>
	<li>So I wrote up a review of the @emerginglangs conference last night. Awesome times (<a href="http://technomancy.us/139 ">here</a>, via @technomancy) -- This review of the conference provides the most complete and accurate summary of what Rich Hickey presented.</li>
	<li>Long blog post on OSCON's Emerging Languages Camp (<a href="http://blog.polyglotprogramming.com/2010/7/26/oscon-emerging-languages-camp">here</a>, via @deamwampler) -- This is an more detailed description of the conference, but with less emphasis (and accuracy) on Clojure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Clojure dropbox API (<a href="http://github.com/aria42/clj-dropbox">here</a>, via @coder_tim) -- Access the <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> API from Clojure (provided you are registered as a Dropbox developer). This API will allow to store your users' data in their own Dropbox accounts.</li>
	<li>#clojure contrib deprecation policy (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/ffdfea1efd0826b6">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- As the march for Clojure 1.2 progresses, it is time to clean-up clojure.contrib since, for example, some functions have moved to clojure.core. This document explains the deprecation policy; in summary, things are marked deprecated one full minor version (the 'x' in 1.x) and possibly removed the next one, so you have that window of time to stop using deprecated functions.</li>
	<li>Writing blog post - collection of #Clojure tips (with code) for newbies. Email me at satishtalim [at] gmail.com (via @IndianGuru) -- This is a request for Clojure programming tips. All worthy tips will end up published in a summary article.</li>
	<li>Developing and Deploying a Simple Clojure Web Application (<a href="http://mmcgrana.github.com/2010/07/develop-deploy-clojure-web-applications.html">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- This is a relatively long and detailed post by Mark McGranahan, the author of <a href="http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring">Ring</a> (amongst other interesting projects). The post covers all the steps that will allow you to create a Clojure web-app, deploy it on your local machine or even on Amazon's EC2 infrastructure. It is a great summary of tools and techniques.</li>
	<li>Did you know about versioning? This time about #clojure infrastructure.Â (<a href="http://kotka.de/blog/2010/07/Did_you_know_VI.html">here</a>, via @kotarak) -- A plea to all Clojure library developers to follow a simple and unified versioning scheme, so we all can keep our sanity (these last words are mine)</li>
	<li>Programming Hadoop with Clojure (<a href="http://alexott.net/en/clojure/ClojureHadoop.html">here</a>, via @alexott_en) -- A detailed rundown of how to write Haddop applications with Clojure and Stuart Sierra's <a href="http://github.com/stuartsierra/clojure-hadoop">clojure-hadoop</a> libraries. It even includes a full example and a bunch of useful links, so it makes it very easy to get you started with Hadoop.</li>
</ul>
