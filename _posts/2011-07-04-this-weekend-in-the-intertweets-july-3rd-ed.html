<ul>
	<li>There's no point in caring about primitives when your code churns a lot of objects. Memory profiling before CPU profing. (via @cgrand) -- A word of advice from the master.</li>
	<li>Hmmm, I wonder what @richhickey's going to talk about? (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Clojure-NYC/events/16166953/">here</a>, via @fogus) -- It looks like Rich Hickey will talk about "something new" for the NYC's clojure meetup. What will that be? My vote is for Forjure, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a> implementation for the JVM ;)</li>
	<li>A programmer has a problem. They decide to use #Clojure. Now they have a WORKING ONE LINE SOLUTION! (via @myfreeweb) -- Clojure, the language for tweets.</li>
	<li>ReadWriteHack: 10+ Free Resources for Learning Clojure (<a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/07/free-e-books-on-clojure.php">here</a>, via @rww) -- As Clojure is becoming mainstream, judging from how far removed is ReadWriteWeb from hard-core language geekery.</li>
	<li>Automatoon: A HTML5 automation service on GAE written in clojure (<a href="http://www.automatoon.com/">here</a>, via @hnfirehose) -- This is built with CoffeeScript on the front end and Clojure on the backend. It lets you create cartoon animations and put them in any web site. The level of awesomeness of this is just hard to describe in a tweet. Watch the video and judge for yourself. It's author also wrote "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Land-Lisp-Learn-Program-Game/dp/1593272812">Land of Lisp</a>".</li>
	<li>Bitly API via Clojure (<a href="http://pseudofish.com/blog/2011/07/03/bitly-api-via-clojure/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Pseudofish+%28PseudoFish%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @gmwils) -- Short and sweet, use Bitly's API to shorten your links from clojure.</li>
	<li>recon - JVM instrumentation reporting library in Clojure (<a href="https://github.com/icylisper/recon">here</a>, via @kumarshantanu) -- Let's you collect run-time statistics from remote JVMs.</li>
