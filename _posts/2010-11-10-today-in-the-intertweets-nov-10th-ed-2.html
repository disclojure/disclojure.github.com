	<li>Exploring some fringes of Clojure: in which the perils of the gilardi scenario are overcome (<a href="http://technomancy.us/143">here</a>, via @technomancy) -- If you get lost writing simple macros, this article might not be for you. It covers a few ways in which you can avoid the issue of eval'ing some code bot loads a variable and uses it. The problem is that the clojure compiler will compile the whole block as t once, not line by line, so by the time it compiles the use of the variable imported, it won't find it.... did I say this was not for the faint of heart? Well, read it anyway, it'll make you a better coder.</li>
	<li>Start each day by reading the implementation of a function or macro in Clojure's core.clj. (via @learnclojure) -- True that!</li>
