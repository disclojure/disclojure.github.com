<ul>
	<li>Very handy #clojure file utils lib. Thanks @xcombinator! (<a href="http://github.com/jashmenn/clj-file-utils">here</a>, via @bmabey) -- "Unix-like filesystem manipulation utilities for Clojure". Pretty cool :)</li>
	<li>Clojure and TDD for the lazy ones (<a href="http://edgargoncalves.posterous.com/clojure-and-tdd-for-the-lazy-ones">here</a>, via @edgargoncalves) -- If you use Emacs and your development process relies heavily on unit testing, this article is for you. It provides an series of enhancements to @technomancy's <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/clojure-mode/">clojure-test-mode</a> to make it easier for you to find test functions and/or create new ones.</li>
	<li>Clojure's Time/Concurrency Model - A Gentle Critique (<a href="http://mikes-tech.blogspot.com/2010/11/clojures-timeconcurrency-model-gentle.html">here</a>, via @X4s_feeds) -- The critique is based around the complexity of keeping a domain model synchronized, i.e. all the entities reflect the state at the same moment in time (if I understood it well, that is). Also comments on the fact that although with Clojure's concurrency model reads are very cheap (i.e. non-blocking), they're not free.</li>
	<li>Book Excerpt and Interview: The Joy of Clojure (<a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/the-joy-of-clojure">here</a>, via @infoq) -- "InfoQ readers can also enjoy a <strong><em>40% off  The</em></strong> Joy of Clojure, by using the code “infoq40” :) Great read.</li>
