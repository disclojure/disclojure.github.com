	<li><a href="http://objectcommando.com/blog/2011/10/13/appendo-the-great/">new blog post "Appendo the Great"</a> (via @objcmdo) -- How to write a logical append with core.logic. Very interesting read, even if you're not knowledgeable about Logic Programming.</li>
	<li>I believe that #midje 1.3-alpha4, just released, works with Clojure 1.3. You'll also need a new lein-midje. (via @marick) -- "believe"? Maybe you should write some midje tests for it so you can say "I know" instead ;). Great news for all moving to 1.3.</li>
