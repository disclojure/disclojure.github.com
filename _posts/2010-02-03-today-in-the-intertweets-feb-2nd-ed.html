	<li>#Clutch autodoc website now up (<a href="http://ashafa.com/clutch/">here</a>, via @ashafa) -- It's nice to see @tomfaulhaber's autodoc being used more and more in clojure projects :)</li>
	<li>(upvote? (= Etch-A-Sketch (reduce + '(Arduino Clojure)))) (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2010/02/02/etch-a-sketch/">here</a>, via @redditspammor) -- An etch-a-sketch built on Clojure controlled by an arduino board. Yet another very creative (and short) project from nakkaya.com

	<li>Portable, Cross Platform, Standalone Reddit Clone in 91 lines of Clojure (<a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2010/02/reddit-clone-in-10-minutes-and-91-lines-of-clojure/">here</a>, via @LauJensen) -- This is about porting a C<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/svc/LispMovies/index.html">ommon Lisp Reddit Clone</a> to Clojure. In this article, along with the code, Lau explores some not-so-subtle differences between CL and Clojure. This is a relatively complex Compojure application, so it is interesting to see how short it is! As a bonus, Lau also adds the steps to deploy this as a portable application using Leiningen.</li>
	<li>Clojure library coding standards -- initial draft (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure-dev/browse_thread/thread/d090b5599909497c">here</a>, via @liebke) -- @stuarhalloway proposes a set of conventions for writing Clojure code. The discussion that follows is very enlightening. Â Weigh in now before it gets set in stone!!!</li>
