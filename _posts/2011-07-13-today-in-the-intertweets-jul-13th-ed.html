<ul>
	<li>Libraries vs Frameworks at our startup (<a href="http://blog.orderharmony.com/2011/07/libraries-vs-frameworks.html">here</a>, via @doooks) -- <a href="http://www.orderharmony.com/">OrderHarmony</a> is a British startup that whose systems are built on Clojure. They wrote this blog post explaining why they prefer libraries over frameworks. Clojure's OS ecosystem is largely based on the former.</li>
	<li>Clojure on Heroku (<a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/07/10/clojure-on-heroku.html">here</a>, via @craigandera) -- How to herokify your Clojure webapp (spoiler, it seems very very easy!)</li>
	<li>The results of the 2011 State of Clojure survey are in! (<a href="http://cemerick.com/2011/07/11/results-of-the-2011-state-of-clojure-survey/">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- Woo hoo! 670 of you took the time to provide fill up the questionnaire, and the results are of course very interesting. Here is a shallow view on the prototypical "you": mostly not at work, you develop web applications with Emacs/Slime, you are a (former?) Java programmer that would try Common Lisp, Haskell or Scala if Clojure were to disappear, you love Functional Programming and you have a list with several aspects of Clojure were you'd like to see improvement. Go check the article for a less shallow view of The State of Clojure.</li>
	<li>Persistent #clojure piece-table impl using finger-trees. Creates an append-only change buffer in text editors. (<a href="https://github.com/ghadishayban/piece-table">here</a>, via @smashthepast) -- This is using Chris Houser's finger-tree implementation to provide <a href="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~crowley/papers/sds.pdf">support for text editors backends</a>.</li>
	<li>Heroku: A development cloud for all seasons: Rails, Node, Clojure, and other hipness (<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/07/11/heroku_does_clojure_and_beyond/">here</a>, via @regvulture) -- Linked because it provides some insight on why Heroku went for Clojure for their third supported language after Ruby/Rails and JavaScript/Node.js (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rit/status/90885350779650048">spoiler</a>?)</li>
	<li>Emblogginated: "No Stinking Mutants" (<a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2011/07/12/no-stinking-mutants/">here</a>, via @fogus) -- Detailed and comprehensive article on the perils of mutability in your code.</li>
