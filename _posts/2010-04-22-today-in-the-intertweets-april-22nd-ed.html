<ul>
	<li>Awesome example of thought leadership: Clojure - datatypes (<a href="http://clojure.org/datatypes">here</a>, via @kyleburton) -- So Rich Hickey finally got around to write about the new datatype features in Clojure 1.2: deftype, defrecord and reify. These features are here to liberate Clojure itself from Java the language and become more independent. They are also faster than gen-class and proxy, but they are not exactly equivalent. Must read.</li>
	<li>is trying to decide whether or not to do a screencast to explain why macros are awesome to C# and Java developers (via @craigandera) -- Craig recently published a <a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/olt/Course.aspx?n=clojure-concurrency-tutorial">6 part screen cast on Concurrency in Clojure</a>. Craig, do it! Will also help in some of those pesky Scala vs. Clojure discussions of late...</li>
	<li>If the main difference between Scala and Clojure is syntax then the main difference between an F-22 Raptor and Boeing 777 is paint color (via @jamesiry)</li>
	<li>huh 40% off on <a href="http://joyofclojure.com/">Joy of Clojure</a> (and other books) with Manning with code a2140 through the 28th. &lt;3 Manning (via @westernwizard)</li>
	<li>40% off #Clojure in Action - use code a2140 at checkout (<a href="http://www.manning.com/rathore/">here</a>, via @amitrathore)</li>
	<li>I've learned a lot about #clojure by skiming/reading <a href="http://clojure-log.n01se.net/">http://clojure-log.n01se.net/</a> every night (via @BrianCarper) -- I couldn't agree more. That address contains archives of the Clojure IRC channel. The Library of the Congress should buy these and not the whole Twitter database as it did recently!</li>
	<li>Did you know about with-open? Start of a small post series for #clojure (<a href="http://kotka.de/blog/2010/04/Did_you_know_I.html">here</a>, via @kotarak) -- What a good start, keep them coming! What is it going to be, a weekly thing?</li>
	<li>Just recorded a fun - and I hope excellent - @makeall with @KirinDave on clojure (<a href="http://www.redmonk.com/cote/2010/04/22/makeall002/">here</a>, via @cote) -- Michael Cot√© is an industry analyst with <a href="http://redmonk.com/">RedMonk</a>. This interview covers the very basics of why one should be interested in Clojure.</li>
