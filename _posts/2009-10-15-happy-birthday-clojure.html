As many of you have already tweeted about, today marks the second anniversary of Clojure's release to the public, as <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/16fec21eb1fff8aa?pli=1">this email</a> from Rich Hickey himself asserts. They have been two fast years, but something makes me think the next few years will feel much faster.

Here's to Clojure: Happy Birthday!
