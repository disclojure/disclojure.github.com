<ul>
	<li>Asked @jetbrains staff at #oredev about #clojure support in @intellijidea 10. Got blank stare back. Worrying. (via @weakreference) -- Whaaaa?
<ul>
	<li>@weakreference the Clojure plugin for IntelliJ IDEA is developed separately from the core product; no plans to bundle it in v10 (via @intelliyole) -- That is a non-response if I've ever seen one :( ... Communication matters guys! Yes it is coming, or not it is not... which one it is?</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Videos de programación funcional (en argentino :-) (<a href="http://www.codeandbeyond.org/2010/11/videos-code-beyond-talk-programacion.html">here</a>, via @EdgarSanchez) -- Some Argentinian hackers got together to talk about functional programming and here are the talks for all of us Spanish speakers to enjoy. Awesome guys!</li>
	<li>I have a good feeling about this blog (<a href="http://boss-level.com/?p=66">here</a>, via @LauJensen) -- A mini-sudoku written with <a href="https://github.com/jduey/mini-kanren">mini-Karnen</a>, a clojure implementation of <a href="http://kanren.sourceforge.net/">mini-kanren</a>, a declarative logic programming system that was originally for scheme.  Check out the 3 previous posts on that blog to get some more background.</li>
	<li>Java, Clojure, Scala, Groovy, and Jython using RubyGems via @yokolet's JRuby embedding API! (<a href="http://servletgarden-point.appspot.com/slideshow">here</a>, via @headius) -- Slide 7 is the one that matters :). Amazing how easy it is to use RubyGems from clojure with <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/jruby/pages/RedBridge">RedBridge</a>! (now, the Scala version is sooooooo much more complicated!). Also check out slide 21 for how to use DataMapper from clojure.</li>
	<li>A wip implementation of haskell's Control.* in clojure: functor,applicative, monad and monoid (<a href="https://github.com/antoniogarrote/clj-control">here</a>, via @jneira) -- <a href="https://github.com/antoniogarrote/clj-control">clj-control</a> is  @antoniogarrote's porting of Haskell's control abstractions to Clojure. WIP as stated.</li>
</ul>
