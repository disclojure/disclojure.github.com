(NOTE: somehow this article got posted in the wrong place of this blog yesterday... so I am reposting it today)
<ul>
	<li>Clojure: A few things I've been tripping up on (<a href="http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2009/11/20/clojure-a-few-things-ive-been-tripping-up-on/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+PlanetTw+%28Planet+TW%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @planettw) -- This article gives an insight on some difficulties that newcomers to LISP in general and Clojure in particular. Sometimes it is easy to realize when talking to non-lispers how there is an impedance mistmatch at the most basic level, especially for those coming from procedural languages.</li>
	<li>Building Incanter applications with Leiningen and Clojars.org (<a href="http://incanter-blog.org/2009/11/20/leiningen-clojars/">here</a>, via @liebke) -- If Leiningen and Clojars.org needed any validation, here it comes. If you need a full example to understand why these two tools are so useful then a look at how easy it is today to create a new Incanter project will help.</li>
	<li>Stuart Sierra (Columbia U.) and Tim Dysinger (Sonian Networks) on Hadoop and Clojure at 'Hadoop World' (<a href="http://www.cloudera.com/blog/2009/11/20/hadoop-world-hadoop-clojure-from-stuart-sierra-and-tim-dysinger/">here</a>, via @cloudera)</li>
	<li>java -Xbootclasspath/a:clojure.jar rocks. Down to 350ms startup time for Clojure (via @atosborne) -- nice!</li>
</ul>
