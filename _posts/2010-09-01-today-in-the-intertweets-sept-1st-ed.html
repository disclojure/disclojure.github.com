	<li>Editing trees in #clojure with clojure.zip (<a href="http://www.exampler.com/blog/2010/09/01/editing-trees-in-clojure-with-clojurezip/">here</a>, via @marick) -- clojure.zip is a functional traverse and modify (well, create modified copies of) trees. How to use this library is not immediately obvious, and this article explains how to use them.</li>
	<li>The Joy of Clojure: Thinking the Clojure Way - Book Review (<a href="http://books.dzone.com/reviews/joy-clojure-thinking-clojure-0">here</a>, via @ibmkhd) -- "reading "Joy of Clojure" might actually require the reader to use a dictionary, as the lexical range used by the authors is broad and might be a barrier". I disagree, english is my third language and I didn't need a dictionary. I even got some of the jokes! This is a horribly shallow review, actually.</li>
	<li>Did you know about linear search in #clojure? (<a href="http://kotka.de/blog/2010/09/Did_you_know_VIII.html">here</a>, via @kotarak) -- Short article explaining how 'contains?' works (which seems to confuse a lot of people) and Â how 'some' is a very useful higher-level function for finding elements in a sequence.</li>
	<li>"at the moment we believe #fsharp and #clojure to be better suited to most organisations for assessing than #scala" (<a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/sites/www.thoughtworks.com/files/files/thoughtworks-tech-radar-august-2010-US-color.pdf">here</a>, via @ptrelford) -- <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/">Technology Radar</a> is an advisory publication by the IT consultancy <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> that periodically reviews new technologies and assesses their levels of maturity and desirability for IT customers. Well, in this issue they are <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/sites/www.thoughtworks.com/files/files/tw-radar-april-2010.pdf">continuing</a> to favor Clojure over Scala... aaaand now it is time to run for cover ;)</li>
