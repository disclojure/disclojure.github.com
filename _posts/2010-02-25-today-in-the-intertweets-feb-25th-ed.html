<ul>
	<li>This ought to be good, Cap-Clug meeting on 3/17 with @richhickey and @stuarthalloway (<a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/586299638/">here</a>, via @mattpodwysocki) -- If you are going to be anywhere between 0 and 1000 miles from Reston (VA) on March 17th, you should definitely plan to attend.</li>
	<li>My #clojure concurrency talk from Øredev is online (<a href="http://www.oredev.org/prod/oredev/site.nsf/docsbycodename/session?opendocument&amp;sid=A63BC77001A119BFC12575D5003BC000&amp;track=2556B90C592E1E23C12575A500499CC6&amp;day=5">here</a>, via @stuarthalloway) -- This talk is an introduction to Clojure and its concurrency features. If you can't go to the meet-up above, you can always watch Stuart Halloway's presentation :)</li>
	<li>rosejn's midi-clj, a high level midi library to play notes, external midi devices in clojure (<a href="http://github.com/rosejn/midi-clj">here</a>, via @ajlopez) -- this will *definitely* be tested this weekend on my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/matrixsynth/1316733635/">Virus Classic</a>!</li>
	<li>rosejn's osc-clj, an Open Sound Control library for Clojure (<a href="http://github.com/rosejn/osc-clj">here</a>, via @ajlopez)</li>
	<li>Talk on "Emerging Languages" in Palo Alto, March 10th (<a href="http://www.sdforum.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.ViewPage&amp;PageID=622">here</a>, via @hamiltonulmer) -- Amit Rathore will be introducing Clojure in that talk. Clojure, Go, Scala and Ruby will be presented.</li>
	<li>#clojure + #chef + #cloud = pallet; great stuff @hugoduncan! (<a href="http://hugoduncan.github.com/pallet/index.html">here</a>, via @jclouds) -- Pallet is used to start provision compute nodes using crane, jclouds and chef. It is designed for use from the REPL, along with Clojure scripts.</li>
	<li>A short preview of ClojureQL (<a href="http://kotka.de/blog/2010/02/A_preview_of_ClojureQL.html">here</a>, via @kotarak) -- ClojureQL is undergoing a lot of changes in the front-end. Here is a sneak preview of how the new front-end will look like.</li>
	<li>A Resettable Memoize in Clojure (<a href="http://www.paullegato.com/blog/memoize-reset-clojure/">here</a>, via @pjlegato) -- Since you cannot reset a memoized function with the 'memoize' function in Clojure's core API (yet), you can always create your own resetteable memoize. Here's how.</li>
	<li>Wrote a blog on using the with-command-line option parser in Clojure (<a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/2010/02/25/clojure-command-line-options/">here</a>, via @puredanger) -- If you need to parse command-line options, know that 'there is a clojure lib for that'... with almost no documentation. Well, "there is a blog post for that too"!</li>
