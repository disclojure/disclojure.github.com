This post actually covers the last few days, since I had a few technical issues (which, on the bright side, resulted in a very faaaaaast SSD in my laptop). Anyway, here you go:
<ul>
	<li>My @clojure_conj talk on Simplicity is now available online: (<a href="http://clojure.blip.tv/file/4824610/">here</a>, via @stuarthalloway) -- If you thought defining simplicity is simple, you are simply oversimplifying.</li>
	<li>Save the date! Clojure Conj 2011 is coming Nov 10-12 to Durham, NC. Register for updates (<a href="http://www.clojure-conj.org/">here</a>, via @clojure_conj) -- Yours truly will be there in disguise. If you are planning on going, <a href="http://www.clojure-conj.org/">don't forget to register</a> so that they know how many people to expect.</li>
	<li>Clojureâ€™s keyword can fill up your PermGen space (<a href="http://www.xcombinator.com/2011/03/02/clojures-keyword-can-fill-up-your-permgen-space/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- Yup kids, keywords don't get garbage-collected.</li>
	<li>Btw Enlive 1.0 is out (<a href="https://github.com/cgrand/enlive">here</a>, via @cgrand) -- It was about time! This site has been (internally) powered via Enlive for over a year now (externally it is still Wordpress, embarrassing, I know.)</li>
	<li>#clojure ring 0.3.7 released, now supports guessing mime-type by url extension. (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ring-clojure/browse_thread/thread/b038e3d38271a817">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- Slowly but surely, ring keeps getting more and more useful</li>
	<li>Build your own Clojure toolkit (<a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/Build-your-own-Clojure-toolkit?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- It might be obvious to Clojurians that come from the Java world, but for old lispers it might be not so obvious: it is pretty easy to share libraries in clojure, and even if a library is only a few lines of code the pain of releasing it is small compared to the benefits.</li>
</ul>
