<ul>
	<li>Most Basic ClojureScript GUI (<a href="http://boss-level.com/?p=102">here</a>, via @devstonez) -- Step by step guide on using Google Closure Lib's GUI from ClojureScript.</li>
	<li>Parsley, now with a modicum of documentation. No release though. (<a href="https://github.com/cgrand/parsley">here</a>, via @cgrand) -- Parlsey is a parser generator library for Clojure that has some interesting runtime characteristics, one of them being that it is incremental (very useful for code editors, for example.)</li>
	<li>Twitter Engineering talks about Storm (<a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2011/08/storm-is-coming-more-details-and-plans.html">here</a>, via @swannodette) -- Since Twitter acquired Backtype (authors of Cascalog) now they have in their hands a ton of clojure goodies. One of them is the upcoming real-time map-reduce-style computation engine by @nathanmarz, named Storm. This article describes what Storm is and how it works. The article makes no mention of Clojure though --I know I know, parentheses scare people off.</li>
