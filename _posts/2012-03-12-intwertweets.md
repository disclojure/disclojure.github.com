  This is a fork of the ClojureScript compiler that generates Scheme
  that can later be compiled to binary. In the supplied example,
  fibonacci, this binary is already faster than clojure, and that's
  not even counting the clojure startup time!

  It is sometimes hard to find examples for calling Clojure code from
  Java, so thanks!
