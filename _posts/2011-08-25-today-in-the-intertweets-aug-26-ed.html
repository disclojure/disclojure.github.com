This is a really really fast runtime. <a href="http://blog.dhananjaynene.com/2011/08/cperformance-comparison-languages-styles-and-vms-java-scala-python-erlang-clojure-ruby-groovy-javascript/">My benchmarking updated</a> (via @dnene) -- The article this tweet refers to is a benchmark between many languages, one of them being Clojure. It looks like the benchmark results have been updated for clojure including a version of the solution that is fully optimized (and much faster than the one originally benchmarked), putting Clojure as one of the fastest languages. Oh, and PyPy is very fast!</li>
