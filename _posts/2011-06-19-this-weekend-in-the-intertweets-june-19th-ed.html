<ul>
	<li>Wrote a post about Plasma, a graph database query engine written in #clojure (<a href="http://lifeisagraph.com/2011/06/12/plasma-a-graph-query-engine.html">here</a>, via @ahzf) -- This is a graph query engine initially designed to work on top of <a href="https://github.com/ninjudd/jiraph">jiraph</a>, a clojure graph database with pluggable backends. Graph databases are used often for working with social networks.</li>
	<li>The 2011 State of Clojure Survey is Open (<a href="http://cemerick.com/2011/06/15/the-2011-state-of-clojure-survey-is-open/">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- Last year's survey results provided a lot of light to what the main issues with clojure adoption were. Please provide your feedback today!</li>
	<li>Clojure and Akka: A match made in ... (<a href="http://blog.darevay.com/2011/06/clojure-and-akka-a-match-made-in/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @yueliufeeds) -- Apparently, not made in Heaven. <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a> is a Scala library (with Java bindings) for actors, STM and other Erlanesque features. There are some overlapping with what Clojure already offers in terms of concurrency, except that Akka can work in a distributed manner. Getting Akka to work nicely with clojure seems challenging...</li>
	<li>Clojure with JavaFX 2.0 &amp; a simple application (<a href="http://blog.altasoft.pl/2011/06/clojure-with-javafx2-0/">here</a> and <a href="http://blog.altasoft.pl/2011/06/clojure-javafx-2-0-simple-app/">here</a>, via @devstonez) -- JavaFX 2.0 has been released, so it is time to play with it. Getting it to work with Clojure (ot at all, it seems) is not a walk in the park. The first article shows how to do so, and the second is a sample clojure + javaFX app.</li>
	<li>New blog post: "State is a fold over events" (<a href="http://www.fnogol.de/archives/2011/06/16/state-is-a-fold-over-events/">here</a>, via @ordnungswprog) -- Nice article in form of a clojure file which you can follow how a complex event handler system is built out of very simple functional constructs.</li>
	<li>Creating single-file Clojure executables (*nix-only) (<a href="http://clojurewise.blogspot.com/2011/06/create-executable-clojure-programs.html">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- This has come up a few times: how to build a clojure single file executable?. The author provides a short and sweet answer for Unix-like OSs.</li>
	<li>Q&amp;A with the creator of Clojure (<a href="http://codequarterly.com/2011/rich-hickey/">here</a>, via @Newsery5) -- This is rather old news, but since I haven't been posting for a while, here it is. Michael Fogus writes an in-depth interview with Rich Hickey for "<a href="http://codequarterly.com/">Code Quarterly</a>, a hackademic journal", a hacker magazine<a href="http://codequarterly.com/about/"> in formation</a> (by Peter Siebel)</li>
	<li>Clojure Development with JBoss - presentation video from JUDCon 2011 (<a href="http://vimeo.com/24775252">here</a>, via @maclausen) -- <a href="http://www.jboss.org/">JBoss</a> is a very well known Java Application Server built by RedHat.</li>
	<li>Java is the past, Clojure is the future. Scala is just the past dressed in hipster jeans. (via @samnewman) -- Clojure is retro-futuristic, no?</li>
	<li>I think this HN Trends chart is really interesting (<a href="http://hntrends.jerodsanto.net/?q=ocaml,+haskell,+scala,+clojure">here</a>, via @puffnfresh) -- This shows the frequency in which haskell, scala, ocaml and clojure are mentioned in hacker news over time. Notice the drop of clojure mentions since Q4 2010...</li>
</ul>
And this is what happens to me when I slack off: a few dozen good blog post to filter and comment on in one sitting. Our baby is finally letting us sleep, and the posts will resume their normal schedule, hopefully this time will be for good.
