<ul>
	<li>I should have named SessionVar SessionRef in #Lift. Refs will be the next frontier in code modularity... and #Clojure does them best. (via @dpp) -- Nice words for Clojure from the author of Scala's leading web framework <a href="http://liftweb.net/">Lift</a>.</li>
	<li>New Release: Clojure Programming: Rough Cuts Version (<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781449310349/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">here</a>, via @OReillyUG) -- You can now buy an early version of "Programming Clojure" by @cemerick, @cgrand and @briancarper</li>
	<li>We hope to also open-source some of the Clojure libs we've built at Revelytix at some point, but not sure exactly what/when (via @puredanger) -- Do you guys need some peer pressure to help figure out what (everything!) and when (now)? <a href="http://www.revelytix.com/">Revelytix</a> is working on interesting Semantic Web problems, so expect some OS releases related to this technology.</li>
