<ul>
	<li>#clojure web dev survey (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/d9bff18ca4b5e845">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- The author of Compojure asks the developers of web applications using clojure for some feedback. Join the conversation if you are one of them.</li>
	<li>Interview with @Fogus, #Clojure #Git #Github #Haskell #Java #Lisp #Scheme #Scala (<a href="http://thegeektalk.com/interviews/fogus/">here</a>, via @TheGeekTalk)</li>
	<li>Interview with @chrishouser, the author of The Joy of Clojure, #Clojure #Scala #Vim (<a href="http://thegeektalk.com/interviews/chouser/">here</a>, via @TheGeekTalk)</li>
	<li>Encounter with incanter - about clojure, incanter and bioinformatics (<a href="http://saaientist.blogspot.com/2010/06/encounter-with-incanter-about-clojure.html">here</a>, via @walshtp) -- "So I borrowed someone's `Programming Clojure` book, got onto some websites, downloaded incanter and gave it a spin this week. And my verdict: I'm impressed." That's coming from a heavy R user. Incanter allows data processing and data analysis all in the same language.</li>
	<li>Enhanced primitive support - where things stand today, from Rich Hickey (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/ab3cf9332431868b?hl=en">here</a>, via @disclojure) -- Rich Hickey posts a summary of all the changes related to the new support for primitive types in Clojure. More details <a href="https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/b4-TTcvBSr3RAZeJe5aVNr/Enhanced_Primitive_Support">here</a>.</li>
	<li>I've been doing some work on a Clojure package manager to replicate the ease of installing packages in R. (<a href="http://github.com/liebke/clj">here</a>, via @liebke) -- Enter "clj", a clojure REPL and package management system. It complements Maven and Leiningen in that instead of providing support for project-oriented jobs, clj provides similar support for ad-hoc jobs. It also makes starting Clojure much easier and provides a nice out-of-the-book experience for newbies.</li>
	<li>Yay! Pune Clojure Workshop is finally happening. If you responded to my survey, you should've received an email by now. (via @ghoseb) -- Cool, training also starting in Asia. That makes it the third continent.</li>
	<li>Leiningen 1.2.0-RC2 is out. Please test it with your Clojure projects (<a href="http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/commit/d94d94db096d690b282f90f3edd5569159ba2cb0">here</a>, via @technomancy) -- A few fixes.</li>
	<li>Clojure's n00b attraction problem (<a href="http://gregslepak.posterous.com/clojures-n00b-attraction-problem">here</a>, via @taoeffect) -- This article is from someone who is new to Clojure and reflects the pains that newbies have to go through to get a workable Clojure environment. The author argues that for Clojure to really take off, the out-of-the-box experience for newcomers needs to be improved a lot. Â He also points out that there are too many different ways to achieve a working environment and that there seems to be no "officially sanctioned" way to do so, leaving those aspiring clojurers with the taks of making decisions that they are not ready for yet.</li>
	<li>First #conjlabs is now completed, hope everybody took some valuable skills with them home. Looking forward to planning the next session! (via @LauJensen) -- If you are in Europe and want to learn Clojure from the European experts, they are planning a new session for sometime in September.</li>
