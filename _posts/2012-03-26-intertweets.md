  The proper name is 神.clj. [神](http://shenlanguage.org/) is a
  'portable functional programming language' that has already been
  implemented 
  on top of CLisp, SBCL, JavaScript, and now Clojure. It offers
  static type checking, lazyness, a full Prolog implementation and a
  ton of other meta-goodies.
