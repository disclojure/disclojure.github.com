<ul>
	<li>Saving #Incanter charts as PDF documents (<a href="http://data-sorcery.org/2010/02/05/pdf-charts/">here</a>, via @liebke) -- Title says it all. Now you can save your nifty charts to a PDF file. It is a real vector-based PDF to boot, not a rasterized one, so the charts in the PDF file scale nicely.</li>
	<li>Dark theme for #Incanter charts (<a href="http://data-sorcery.org/2010/02/06/set-theme/">here</a>, via @liebke) -- Apparently where David Liebke lives there are no weekends, only weekdays, so he keeps improving his Incanter project.</li>
	<li>Take a look at the proposed Rohner Arrow (<a href="https://gist.github.com/296970/8485a1f42c4b898426caf4cb5ce6b72e2350f9d4">here</a>, via @fulldisclojure) -- Awesome macro that lets you ...er, just take a look at the code snippet below:</li>
</ul>
[clj]
user=&gt; (macroexpand-all '(-&gt;r c (+ _ 32) (* 1.8 _)))
(* 1.8 (+ c 32))

<ul>
	<li>Want to play with a clojure CLR REPL and don't want to compile it yourself? I've made a crude installer (<a href="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/paulbatum/clojure-clr/Clojure.Setup.msi">here</a>, via @paulbatum) -- Clicking the link will prompt your browser to download said installer. I have not tested it, since I do not have a Windows machine.</li>
	<li>I just released some updates to CLJENV. If you didn't know, it's like virtualenv for Clojure (<a href="http://github.com/offbytwo/cljenv">here</a>, via @offbytwo) -- Lets you work (on Unix) with different Clojure environments, and be able to switch between them easily. "CLJENV includes clojure and contrib 1.1, slime, clojure-mode and swank-clojure. Also, a clojure script that does what you expect."</li>
	<li>rewrote clojure-json encoder using clojure 1.2 protocols, more than 2x speedup for same functionality. Yay! (via @danlarkin) -- Great anecdotal evidence that that the new protocol addition was a good decision.</li>
	<li>Mu: Google AI Challenge in Clojure (<a href="http://whollyweirdwyrd.blogspot.com/2010/02/google-ai-challenge-in-clojure.html">here</a>, via @jneira) -- Google sponsors an <a href="http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/contest/">AI Challenge</a> with the University of Waterloo to create the smartest 'tron' player. The author provides a clojure version of the 'starter-package' that Google has made available for the challengers. Below is a video of a few 'tron' AI players playing. Happy hacking!!!</li>
