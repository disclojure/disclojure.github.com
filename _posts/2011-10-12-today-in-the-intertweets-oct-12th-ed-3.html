	<li><a href="http://gigix.thoughtworkers.org/2011/10/12/c-mon-it-s-turing-machine-part-1">I wrote a Turing Machine with Clojure...C'mon, It's Turing Machine!</a> (via @gigix) -- Does this prove that Clojure is Turing Complete? Interesting work nonetheless.</li>
	<li><a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/2011/10/12/2-is-a-smell/">Blogged: "2 is a smell" </a>(via @puredanger) -- Zero, one, many! 2? Why 2? If your code is expecting certain things in some exact position in a sequence, that is suspicious. Not wrong yey, just Guantanamo suspicious.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.searchco.de/">Buscador/diccionario de comandos</a> (vi a@ieeear) -- This is a searcher for commands for multiple languages. Try 'pmap' for example. Then try Â 'map'.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.screenr.com/ap0s">Made a little visualizer for http://ai-class.com tree searching with Clojure/Incanter/Processing</a> (via @stevelosh) -- If you're taking the <a href="http://ai-class.com">Artificial Intelligence class at Stanford</a> (online, 160K students registered) then this will interest you. Not taking that class? Still interesting.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/daveray/vimclojure-easy">Frustrated by setting up vimclojure? Does this help? </a>(via @darevay) -- This is a github project with files and instructions on setting up vimclojure to work beautifully.</li>
