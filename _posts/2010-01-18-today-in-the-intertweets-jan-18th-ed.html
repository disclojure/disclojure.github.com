<ul>
	<li>Ideone.com : Online IDE &amp; Debugging Tool. You can run C#, Clojure, COBOL, Common Lisp, and +more (<a href="http://ideone.com/">here</a>, via @ajlopez) -- It's both a way to share code snippets and also an IDE. Pretty cool indeed!</li>
	<li>Just gone public with a little open-sourcery - Couverjure, a Cocoa bridge for Clojure (<a href="http://github.com/allertonm/Couverjure">here</a>, via @MarkAllerton) -- "I had this crazy idea that Clojure might play nicer with Cocoa than Java did, and wanted to see if I was right." According to the author, the code is still in "proof-of-concept" stage. Still, if you want to see how it looks today, <a href="http://github.com/allertonm/Couverjure/blob/master/Examples/BasicCocoa/src/clojure/couverjure/examples/basiccocoa.clj">here is a snippet</a>.</li>
	<li>new #enclojure is out with #clojure 1.1 support and #netbeans 6.8. Works great so far! (<a href="http://github.com/EricThorsen/enclojure/downloads">here</a>, via @prpatel) -- <a href="http://netbeans.org/">Netbeans</a> has become a very fast and usable multi-language IDE lately. <a href="http://www.enclojure.org/">Enclojure</a> is a very well rounded plugin for Netbeans to work with Clojure code. Their <a href="http://www.enclojure.org/REPLSupport">REPL support</a> is quite unique and smart. You will need to grab the file at the top of the downloads page (named "enclojure-plugin-2010-jan.nbm")</li>
	<li>Just finished hacking GridFS support into Clojure's MongoDB driver (<a href="http://github.com/purcell/congomongo">here</a>, via @sanityinc) -- <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/GridFS">GridFS</a> adds support for very large objects into <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Home">MongoDB</a>. The clojure driver for MongoDB (<a href="http://github.com/purcell/congomongo">congomongo</a>) keeps getting more and more functionality.</li>
