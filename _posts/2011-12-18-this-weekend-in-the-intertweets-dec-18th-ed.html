<ul>
	<li><a href="http://notes.3kbo.com/clojure">I just ran across a good resource for Clojure tools for Semantic Web dev</a> (via @mark_l_watson) -- Quite extensive. Bookmarked!</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.secondplanetanimation.com/2011/12/14/clojure-clis/">Creating a Clojure CLI's</a> (via @capotribu) -- A very approachable article about writing Command Line applications in Clojure.</li>
	<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/1485920">Working on a CouchDB type for #Clojure</a> (via @cemeric) -- This is very interesting: trying to make working with CouchDB documents similar to working with Clojure maps.</li>
	<li><a href="http://krisjordan.com/multimethod-js">multimethod.js - a Clojure-inspired multimethod library for JavaScript</a> (via @hnfirehose) -- At this point, shouldn't you just move on to ClojureScript? In any case, more evidence of how ductile JavaScript is: Scheme in Java disguise.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/aredington/monotony">awesome use of core.logic by @holy_chao</a> (via @swannodette) -- And an interesting project in itself: "Monotony is a solution to the problem of how to schedule things in a way that humans find intuitive."</li>
	<li><a href="http://xahlee.org/comp/list_comprehension.html">What's List Comprehension and Why is It Harmful?</a> (via @xah_lee) -- They are deemed harmful?!?!? If so, then some of my codes should be considered weapons of mass destruction. The article makes a good point, which is that functional languages already have the primitives to build the functionality.</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.orfjackal.net/2011/12/why-use-inferior-tools.html">The reason why I chose to use Java instead of Scala or Clojure. Why Use Inferior Tools</a> (via @orfjackal) -- See, the main threat to Clojure adoption is not that developers will chose to move to another JVM language, but that they'll decide to stay in Java. Tooling matters, much.</li>
	<li><a href="http://christophermaier.name/blog/2011/07/07/writing-elegant-clojure-code-using-higher-order-functions/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+christopher-maier+%28Christopher+Maier%29">Writing Elegant Clojure Code Using Higher-Order Functions</a> (via @planetclojure) -- If you are new to Clojure and you wonder why some people are so ga-ga over Higher Order Functions (HOFs) then this is for you. Â And if you're seasoned, it won't hurt to read it, just in case. If you come from Haskell and the likes, don't bother. An introduction to the use of HOFs in Clojure.</li>
	<li><a href="http://imgur.com/fD3rA">I've prettied up swank-clojure stack traces a LOT. Here's a taste of what they look like now</a> (via @dmansen) -- Ooooo! Pretty!!!!</li>
	<li><a href="http://christophermaier.name/blog/2011/04/30/not-so-private-clojure-functions/">Not-So-Private #Clojure Functions Short and to the point! That's the kind of article I like the most. </a>(via @jaceklaskowski) -- How to get around the 'private' restriction in defn- functions (for testing, of course!)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.pixelmachine.org/2011/12/17/Testing-Storm-Topologies.html">Nice post by @schleyfox on testing Storm topologies in Clojure </a>(via @nathanmarz) -- In Storm (the real time, fault-tolerant, distributed computation thingie) you can describe the topology of the setup via Clojure. This article is about testing those topologies. Can you count the level of abstractions over basic coding? Yeah, me neither.</li>
</ul>
Phew! That was a long post. Keep it up guys!
