	<li>A post on <a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/2011/08/12/subclassing-in-clojure/">my trevails with gen-class and proxy for subclassing</a> in #clojure yesterday (via @puredanger) -- "I ran into (not for the first time) some issues around subclassing an abstract class and properly overriding a method from the parent class. For my own future sanity (and perhaps yours dear reader), I thought I’d collect a few links and an example or two here." Evernoted. It's not a question of <em>whether</em> this post will become handy, but <em>when</em>. The solution is not obvious.</li>
	<li><a href="http://spootnik.org/blog/2011/08/12/a-bit-of-protocol/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29">A bit of protocol</a> (via @planetclojure)  -- This post will interest to clojurians that come from Ruby, and relates how Ruby and Clojure can open and extend an existing class (that we don't own). The Clojure solution is using Protocols.</li>
	<li>Brand new! <a href="https://github.com/daveray/dorothy">Dorothy</a>: build and render <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> graphs from the comfort of #Clojure (via @darevay) -- Very cool, create Graphviz diagrams with a <a href="http://weavejester.github.com/hiccup/">hiccup</a>-style DSL.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV7zbzH37Qo">Screencast demo of Clojurecraft </a>-- a framework for writing Minecraft bots in Clojure for the #minecraft addicts out there (via @svdberg) -- Title says it all. Fun to watch.</li>
	<li>examples of using clojure + clojurescript spring up everywhere, <a href="http://boss-level.com/?p=119&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">this one</a> shows the basics (via @pyr) -- The basics of AJAX communication between a ClojureScript client and a Clojure server.  Another keeper.</li>
	<li>Emblogginated: "<a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2011/08/14/perlis-languages/">Perlis Languages</a>" (via @fogus) -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Perlis">Alan Perlis</a> said that "A language that doesn’t affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing."  Michael Fogus compiles in this excellent article a list of the other languages that you should be learning to expand your programming abilities in unexpected ways.</li>
