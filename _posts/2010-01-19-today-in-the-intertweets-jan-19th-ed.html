<ul>
	<li>Clojure refactoring: flattening reduces (<a href="http://clj-me.cgrand.net/2010/01/19/clojure-refactoring-flattening-reduces/">here</a>, via @jneira) -- Another Â instance clojure sorcery from @cgrand. Go check it out, as it is hard to summarize such a short but interesting blog post!</li>
	<li>#Clojure has a #Maven repository! <a href="http://build.clojure.org/releases">http://build.clojure.org/releases</a> and <a href="http://build.clojure.org/snapshots">http://build.clojure.org/snapshots</a> (via @stuartsierra)</li>
	<li>Suh-WEET CLojureMVC (<a href="http://github.com/michelvollebregt/clojuremvc">here</a>, via @lazycoder) -- This is a clojure wrapper to Spring MVC, making it easier to use its features from Clojure.</li>
	<li>Agony of hadoop/clojure logging and how to fix it (<a href="http://measuringmeasures.blogspot.com/2010/01/agony-of-clojurehadoop-logging-and-how.html">here</a>, via @bradfordcross) -- Interesting post about the difficulties of obtaining logging data from clojure code running in different environments. *out* means a different thing depending on where and how you run your clojure code. The article refers to the difficulties of obtaining Hadoop's log messages in the REPL when using emacs-slime-swank. Check out the comments section too, as they propose alternative solutions.</li>
	<li>"Clojure 1.1 and Beyond" slides from @fogus' talk at #cap_clug meetup (<a href="http://bit.ly/8xmQRx">here</a>, via @liebke) -- A nice summary of the new features of Clojure 1.1 and what's probably coming for the next release.</li>
	<li>ug, upgraded to #intellij 9.0.1, la #clojure plugin no longer compatible. Hope new version comes out soon. #scala still works though. (via @wmcagyver) -- Don't update to 9.0.1 until a new plugin build for "La Clojure" is available. I really wonder why this happens so often... the IDEA plugin APIs are frozen now so the plugins should be forward compatible for all 9.x versions of IDEA :(</li>
	<li>N-element tuples with type declarations (<a href="http://paste.lisp.org/+208Q">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) -- A few possible implementations of N-tuples in Clojure. With micr0-benchmarks! Although the last one at the time of writing this, by Rich Hickey, has no benchmarks yet.</li>
