  Another novel idea in Clojure beign ported to other languages: "Not a
  long time ago I learned about clojureâ€™s polymorphism constructs and
  protocols. I was so inspired by a porwer and flexibility of protocol
  based polymorphism that I decide to prototyped it for JS. In this
  post I will try to give you a taste of protocols and maybe even
  motivate you give them a try."

  Yay indeed! With the upcoming new version of leiningent [lein2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/NEWS.md) and
  its included library [pomegranate](https://github.com/cemerick/pomegranate) you can now add libraries to your
  classpath directly within the REPL, while also bringing in all the
  transitive dependencies for such library, maven-style. No more need
  to have exit and reload the REPL for such matters.
