  This is the recording of a talk about making Tail Call Optimization
  performant enought in the Clojure/JVM. I couldn't find the slides,
  and the video is not good enough to read the slides either, but the
  audio is good.

  In this article Michael Fogus describes ClojureScripts compilation
  pipeline and how projects like [Typed
  Clojure](https://github.com/frenchy64/typed-clojure) or [binary
  compilation via
  Gambit](https://github.com/takeoutweight/clojure-scheme) fit in.

  How to call a private function in Clojure

 comment: >
  This is an awesome trick that has many uses, for example writing
  unit tests for a private function, or using private functions in
  macros. Both would not be possible if it wasn't for this workaround
  the privacy of functions.
