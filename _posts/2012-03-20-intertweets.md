  The ThoughtWorks tech radar for March 2012 is out: some of my favourites are moving inward...

  Clojure moved from "Assess" to "Try", which is good. Still far from
  "OMG you should totally use it!"

  Good morning Clojure/West!

  It is hard to describe what the conference was by way of tweets. The
  slides [are
  available](https://github.com/strangeloop/clojurewest2012-slides),
  and the videos will soon start appearing at
  [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com). [Datomic](http://datomic.com) had its
  [official
  debut](http://www.infoq.com/news/2012/03/clojure-west?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter)
  and many people talked about real world clojure. There is even
  a [good
  summary](http://blog.darevay.com/2012/03/best-of-clojurewest-2012/).
  I had a blast, fwiw.

 comment: >
  Woo hoo! Some clojure projects already had proposals coming in! What
  does this mean? "Google Summer of Code is a global program that
  offers students stipends to write code for open source projects. We
  have worked with the open source community to identify and fund
  exciting projects for the upcoming summer."

  C2: Clojure(Script) data visualization
 author: puredanger
 url: http://keminglabs.com/c2/
 comment: >
  Inspired by D3, but since it is much easier to use, then C2 is an
  apt name. There is no excuse now for your app not having cool ways
  to present data...

  The cognitive dissonance of watching yet another Scala community
  existential crisis unfold while surrounded by happy Clojure

  Here's to hoping the Scala community finds a good therapist.

  "Extract triples from RDFa 1.1 XHTML and HTML documents using
  Clojure", for semantic web purposes I take.

  Yikes! Google indexing is fast. 5 minutes to pick up my Clojure and
  Wolfram Alpha blog post
 author: mark_l_watson

 comment: >
  Access [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/) from clojure,
  by wrapping the Java API. This is dangerous!
