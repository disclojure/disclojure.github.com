<ul>
	<li>Example of #websocket based chat using #clojure and #jetty 7 by Chris McDevitt, in GitHub repo with deps (<a href="http://twitter.com/maclausen/status/19730372168">here</a>, via @maclausen) -- The example code in github is not new, but in its original form it was somewhat involved to get it to work. This blog post explains how to do just that.</li>
	<li>We are sponsoring the Clojure Language Development Project (<a href="http://thoughts.contegix.com/2010/07/28/global-tech-company-contegix-to-sponsor-open-source-language-project-clojure/">here</a>, via @contegix) -- From the press release it looks like the sponsoring will come in form of free hosting of servers. That's great news!</li>
	<li>Preannouncing Seph - Immutable Ioke/Clojure-like JVM language (<a href="http://olabini.com/blog/2010/07/preannouncing-seph/">here</a>, via @hncomments) -- Ola Bini writes a blog post detailing the design principles for his new language Seph, one of these principles being "Stealing is Good". On this note he decides to 'borrow', amongst other things from other places, Clojure's persistent data structures, the concurrency primitives (all of them) and the STM. I wonder if he will also start sporting a mullet? Jokes aside, Seph is based on <a href="http://olabini.com/blog/2010/07/preannouncing-seph/">Ioke</a>, also from Ola. Seph is a homoiconic language that supports prototype-based OO. Since Ioke is very experimental, Seph is designed from the ground to be solid enough to be used in real applications. Seph was presented at Emerging Langs a week ago, and <a href="http://olabini.com/presentations/Ioke-Seph-EmergingLanguages.pdf">here are the slides</a>.</li>
	<li>Some ideas on how to write event-driven applications in #clojure using #aleph (<a href="http://wiki.github.com/ztellman/aleph/">here</a>, via @ztellman) -- Zach Tellman outlines his work in progress on a framework to develop event-driven applications to work with <a href="http://github.com/ztellman/aleph">aleph</a>, the non-blocking nettty-based web server. In this article the author introduces channels and pipelines as basic abstractions.</li>
	<li>Couple more seats remaining for the Bay Area Clojure Bootcamp - learn #Clojure in a single day! (<a href="http://www.ProClojure.com/">here</a>, via @amitratore) -- Learn Clojure from "Clojure in Action"'s author.</li>
