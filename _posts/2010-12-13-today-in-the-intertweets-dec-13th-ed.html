	<li>9 Programming Languages in 2011: Go, R, Lua, Scheme, ActionScript, Erlang, Groovy, Scala, Clojure (<a href="http://regulargeek.com/2010/12/11/9-programming-languages-to-watch-in-2011/">here</a>, via @grammarware) -- This article tries to parse the different job demand data available to make a prediction about which languages posed to grow significantly next year. Clojure comes third, after Lua and R.</li>
	<li>Those starting with Clojure &amp; Compojure, that are confused with all the tutorials based on old versions, rather use (<a href="https://github.com/weavejester/compojure/wiki/Getting-Started">here</a>, via @jaquesdp) -- Good tip!</li>
	<li>Conj video posted! @fogus, "Fertile Ground: The Roots of Clojure" (<a href="http://clojure.blip.tv/file/4501296/">here</a>, via @clojure_conj) -- Michael Fogus goes over all the fountains that Clojure drinks from &lt;-- Direct transliteration of a Spanish idiom, by the way.</li>
	<li>I just published a clojure Redis session store for Ring. Check it out (<a href="https://github.com/paraseba/rrss">here</a>, via @paraseba) -- It's a drop-in replacement for the native Ring session store.</li>
