<ul>
	<li>Controlling run-away trains, onions, and exercise bikes (<a href="http://blog.n01se.net/?p=85">here</a>, via @chrishouser) -- Under this cryptic title there is an article full of REPL wisdom. What to do if you somehow print an infinite sequence at the REPL? What if it is an infinitely recursive sequence? What if you called a function that will take forever to terminate?. Find the answers to these questions in this article.</li>
	<li>how Ring, the Clojure web application library, go its name (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/6zAYD.jpg">here</a>, via @mmcgrana) -- You actually have to squint with your eyes and stare at the picture for 10 minutes, and then you'll see a ring!</li>
	<li>Just published a quick walkthrough of pulling and using an R package from Clojure/Incanter (<a href="http://joelboehland.com/posts/all-your-datasets-r-belong-to-us.html">here</a>, via @jolby) -- After a few tweets about <a href="http://github.com/jolby/rincanter">Rincanter</a>, a binding for <a href="http://incanter.org/">Incanter</a> (based on Clojure) to the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R Language for statistical computing</a>, Joel Boehland produces this introduction to this new project.</li>
	<li>Discussion on session handling in ring, a #clojure web app lib (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/a7d020f8c76ecb77">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- Ring is about to get session support and his author (@mmcgrana) is asking which way to go: mutable or immutable sessions? Â If you develop web apps with Clojure now it is your chance to weigh in!</li>
