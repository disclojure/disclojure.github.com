<ul>
	<li>Just released Radagast, my Clojure test coverage experiment (<a href="http://github.com/Seajure/radagast">here</a>, via @technomancy)</li>
	<li>If you are tracking bleeding edge #clojure, it's been moved from github.com/richhickey to github.com/clojure (via @wmacgyver)</li>
	<li>making #clojure records more pleasant to import, create, and print (<a href="http://david-mcneil.com/post/765563763/enhanced-clojure-records">here</a>, via @david_mcneil) -- An enhanced implementation of 'record', one of the new features slated for Clojure 1.2. This alternative implementation allows you to work with records in a similar way you work with other data structures on Clojure. It allows you to pretty print the contents of a record and to create new records without invoking the Java constructor; two things that are not possible with the current 'record' as defined in 1.2</li>
	<li>New Course: Clojure for Beginners. Course fees to be donated to the #Clojure project (<a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/07/04/new-course-clojure-for-beginners/">here</a>, via @IndianGuru) -- Starts Monday July 19th, and costs $5. The entire proceeds will be donated to support the development of Clojure.</li>
	<li>Nu: lisp on objective c. (think clojure for cocoa) (<a href="http://github.com/timburks/nu">here</a>, via @hkrnws) -- I thought you guys would be interested on this...</li>
</ul>
