<ul>
	<li>New post on building REST APIs for Clojure web apps (<a href="http://mmcgrana.github.com/2010/08/clojure-rest-api.html">here</a>, via @mmcgrana) -- Step by step creation of JSON-based RESTful web services in Clojure using Compojure and clj-json.</li>
	<li>Joy of #Clojure -- In the Books! updated ToC at <a href="http://">http://joyofclojure.com</a> (<a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2010/08/05/joy-of-clojure-in-the-books/">here</a>, via @fogus) -- The book "The Joy of Clojure" is now ready for editorial work, as the bulk of the writing it is done. Congratulations! Can't wait to have a hard copy one of these days; before November maybe?. There has been some chapter reorganization and a new and promising chapter containing an annotated bibliography that will surely will help deplete our collective bank accounts.</li>
	<li>Send Growl notifications from #Clojure. Too much work for such a simple thing (<a href="http://github.com/brentonashworth/clj-growl">here</a>, via @brentonashworth) -- That is one fun project. It should to be adopted by tools like Cascalog so that they can tell you when your map/reduce job is done.</li>
