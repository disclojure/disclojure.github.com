<ul>
	<li>Easy plugin extensibility for Clojure projects (<a href="http://github.com/technomancy/robert-hooke">here</a>, via @technomancy) -- Similar to Emacs Lisp's defadvice, this library provides is a method to add new behavior to existing functions... in only 30 lines of code!</li>
	<li>Rocking here at @thinkrelevance on #opensourcefriday banging on a swing clojure repl, see progress <a href="http://people.rit.edu/~awd4182/clojurerepl.png">here</a> (via @alandipert) -- Oooohh, a Swing REPL for Clojure!
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left; ">behold, first cut of clojure swingrepl (<a href="http://github.com/alandipert/clj-swingrepl">here</a>, via @alandipert) -- Source code is available.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left; ">Thanks to @alandipert, I finally have #Incanter executables. (<a href="http://data-sorcery.org/2010/06/12/incanter-executables/">here</a>, via @liebke) -- Wow, that didn't take very long! Incanger now uses swingrepl and in addition, now you can download Incanter as a single executable file for Mac and Windows (with fancy application icons to boot!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>1st results of the Clojure commercial "editor" survey (<a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewanalytics?formkey=dHVEYUg3V3dMZjc0VDdNUFhWMGJ2bmc6MQ">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- The <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dHVEYUg3V3dMZjc0VDdNUFhWMGJ2bmc6MQ">poll is still up</a> if you'd like to have your say. It looks like there are plenty of developers willing to pay upwards of $250 for such IDE; more than 50% of them, but then the majority would also want the project to be open sourced...</li>
	<li>OH: "vim + clojure should go together great. text is immutable in vim, unless explicitly marked mutable." (via @redinger)</li>
	<li>#Terrastore #Clojure Client APIs unveiled (<a href="http://github.com/sbtourist/terrastore-cloj">here</a>, via @sbtourist) -- <a href="http://code.google.com/p/terrastore/">Terrastore</a> is a data store based on <a href="http://www.terracotta.org/">Terracotta's clustering technology</a>. This library allows access to terrastore from Clojure.</li>
	<li>crazy idea of the week - Clojure GWT (<a href="http://epistemologicalengineering.blogspot.com/2010/06/crazy-idea-of-week-clojure-gwt.html">here</a>, via @nickmain_) -- Crazy indeed.  <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">GWT</a> (Google Web Toolkit) is a toolkit for creating complex Java+JavaScript/Ajax applications used and promoted by google. GWT relies heavily on the code being written in Java, as it uses a specialized Java compiler to generate the JavaScript code. Not trivial.</li>
	<li>TDD in Clojure: a sketch (part 1. My workflow and notation. (<a href="http://www.exampler.com/blog/2010/06/11/tdd-in-clojure-a-sketch-part-1/">here</a>, via @marick) -- The author is trying to find what would be a realistic Test Driven Development workflow for working with Clojure. It is not immediate to translate your Imperative Language of Choice's TDD into a Functional Language of Choice TDD...</li>
	<li>clj-ds: Clojure’s persistent data structures for Java (<a href="http://blog.higher-order.net/2010/06/11/clj-ds-clojures-persistent-data-structures-for-java/">here</a>, via @planet_lang) -- This is a port/fork of Clojure's persistent data structures so they can be used from Java, but also so that they still exist when Clojure moves the code for this data structures from being written in Java to being written in Clojure. The author promises to keep this Java version of the libs in sync with the future Clojure ones. Finally, this library does not depend on Clojure's runtime, so there is no bootstrap time to speak of.</li>
