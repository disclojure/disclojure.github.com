<ul>
	<li>My latest micro-interview focused on #Clojure is with Justin Balthrop (aka. @ninjudd) (take 6 (justin-balthrop)) (<a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2010/11/30/take-6-justin-balthrop/">here</a>, via @fogus) -- Learn about the back history of <a href="http://clojure-cake.org/">cake</a>, about a<a href="https://github.com/ninjudd/jiraph"> graph database library</a> and a few <a href="https://github.com/ninjudd/uncle">new</a> <a href="https://github.com/ninjudd/depot">projects</a> coming from the guys working at <a href="http://www.geni.com/">Geni</a>.</li>
	<li>this forrester analyst is chalk full of wrong on so many levels. java is dead ? so is scala clojure ruby? yep, done. (<a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=61352">here</a>, via @john_hager) -- What? Clojure is dead? Since when? Why didn't anybody tell me? So I have been programming a corpse?!?! I must have, since Forrester<a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/mike_gualtieri/10-11-23-java_is_a_dead_end_for_enterprise_app_development"> said so</a> apparently.</li>
