	<li>Episode 16 is up - Enterprise #Clojure (<a href="http://vimeo.com/10714859">here</a>, via @fulldisclojure) -- Grab data from different formats (Excel, XML, text, etc..), transform it into a unified format and then perform SQL-style operations on the aggregated data from all those sources.</li>
	<li>Getting started with Clojure (<a href="http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/clojure/Getting_Started">here</a>, via @jimduey) -- @stuartsierra and others have been hard at work updating clojure's wiki to provide the steps to setup a Clojure development environment with the most popular IDEs: Netbeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc...</li>
	<li>Need a venue for the April London Clojure Dojo. We need room for 15-30, wifi and a projector. Pizza and beer provided. (via @otfrom) -- Any takers?</li>
	<li>Just pushed 1.0.0 of Yoink, my Scala library for stealing Clojure's persistent, immutable maps. Enjoy! (<a href="http://github.com/codahale/yoink">here</a>, via @coda) -- Scala keeps taking pages from Clojure's book. Will macros come next? .... I wouldn't think so either.</li>
