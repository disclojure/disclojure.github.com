	<li><a href="http://lisp-univ-etc.blogspot.com/2011/11/clojure-complexity.html">Clojure &amp; Complexity </a>(via @planet_lisp) -- Yesterday it was Scala that got a private-turned-public beating, and today it's Clojure-bashing day, it seems. A decent summary would be "Clojure is not Common Lisp" and "we don't need Clojure, we can do everything in Common Lisp".</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/aredington/fidjet">Hey I made a thing to make configuration of functions easier, try messing around with it</a> (via @holy_chao) -- Fidjet is the name of the project, and "If you write a core API where functions accept some config parameter as their first argument, you can then create a parallel namespace where those same functions can be used in a with-config block."</li>
