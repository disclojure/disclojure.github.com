  When was the last time you got really excited about a picece of
  software? You could turn this excitement into an action to help make
  Light Table a reality, by [backing it financially](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/306316578/light-table).

  Well, this was hard. Serializable functions + their closures for #clojure

  Nathan Marz has extended
  [serializable-fn](https://github.com/technomancy/serializable-fn) to serialize clojure
  functions into a stream of numbers. With this you can send those numbers
  over the network or save them into storage, I think.
