	<li>Explanation of "Lose your head" in lazy sequences (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5698122/explanation-of-lose-your-head-in-lazy-sequences">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- You might have heard (or read) many times the expression "losing your head" in the context of Clojure. This is a question in Stack Overflow that explores what this actually means. The example used is very neat and somebody also provided data in graphical form about how when you are not losing you head, you might might be losing your memory.</li>
	<li>Considering adding unnecessary dependencies to a #clojure project so stakeholders will find the code size to be believable :-) (via @stuarthalloway) -- Maybe expand your macros?</li>
	<li>Clojure vs Java, protocols ftw! (<a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/2011/04/18/clojure-vs-java/">here</a>, via @puredanger) -- This is a short articles that exemplifies what is neat about clojure protocols and datatypes. It does so by explaining how to solve the same problem both in clojure and in java (the latter he doesn't even attempt to do). I believe this is a good example of what the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem">"expression problem</a>" is.</li>
