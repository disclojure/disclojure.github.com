	<li>About Rich Hickey fundraiser drive for Clojure development:
<ul>
	<li>Initial list of Clojure "funders" posted – very proud to be the first commercial sponsor of Clojure (<a href="http://clojure.org/funders">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- Neat, Rich fundraise is now around at 40% of his goal.</li>
	<li>Clojure is great for the Java community! Sonatype just donated US1000 at http://clojure.org. We challenge you to match the donation!</li>
	<li>Sonian is very proud to be the first monthly invoiced commercial sponsor of #clojure (via @dysinger) -- $1000/mo, not bad at all. It look like Sonian did take the challenge of Sonatype, and then made it a monhly. Thank you from all of us!</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>My take on @timbray's Widefinder 2 benchmark in #clojure. (<a href="http://meshy.org/2009/12/13/widefinder-2-with-clojure.html">here</a>, via @atosborne) -- To cut the story short, now the Clojure version of Widefinder 2 is faster than Scala and Java, only bested by C++ and OCaml. @atosborne's version -- which is tested in the same hardware that @timbray used for all the other tests -- is now taking 8m4.633s of real (elapsed) time. <a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/WideFinder/Results">Here is the table</a> with the other competing implementations of WF2. This is again another great read for those planning on using Clojure on big iron and squeze every power out of it.</li>
	<li>@assembla uses #Clojure as a showcase in their latest newsletter (via @stuartsierra) -- Can be found in the "Featured Open Source Projects" section of that letter. Here is what it says: "Clojure is a dialect of Lisp that runs in a JVM, and shares with the Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures."</li>
	<li>The #paredit (for #clojure) is on Slideshare (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mudphone/paredit-preso">here</a>, via @mudphone) -- If you're using Emacs, especially @technomancy's Emacs Starter Kit, then you're probably using (or want to use) 'paredit'. Here is a presentation from the last <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/">Bay Area Clojure User Group</a> meeting.</li>
