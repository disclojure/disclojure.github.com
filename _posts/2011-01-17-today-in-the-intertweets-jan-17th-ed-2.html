<ul>
	<li>@kirkwy is 100% on the mark I've been saying this a while but he is much more eloquent. Same applies to Clojure,F# etc (<a href="http://kirkwylie.blogspot.com/2011/01/scala-considered-harmful-for-large.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+KirksRants+%28Kirk%27s+Rants%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @fortyrunner) -- This is a rather long but thoughtful article about the perils of adding a new language to a large Java project. It is directed to Scala, but as the author of the tweet remarks, it applies to other higher level languages that work over a host language (JVM, .NET)</li>
	<li>Namespaces for Clojure's Deftype and Defrecord (<a href="http://dbostwick.posterous.com/using-clojures-deftype-and-defrecord-and-name">here</a>, via @hnfirehose) -- I am sure most of you that tried deftypes and defrecords were hit by this at first. Those two types result in Java classes being created. This means that they're both Clojure and Java types, and therefore they need to be imported twice, both as Clojure (use, require) and as Java (import)</li>
	<li>New #clojure conj video up, @cgrand: (not= DSL macros) (<a href="http://blip.tv/file/4522250">here</a>, via @clojure_conj) -- Christophe Grand's presentation at the Conj was about how sometimes one can avoid using macros in places where they seemed required -- DSL building in this case-- and gain a lot of extra flexibility from this.</li>
	<li>A Very Gentle Introduction to Information Theory: Guessing the Entropy (<a href="http://www.learningclojure.com/2011/01/very-gently-introduction-to-information.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- John Lawrence Aspden is running a series of articles on Information Theory using Clojure.  At this moment there are already 4 posts about it.</li>
	<li>Now every time I have to write a for(int i=0; ...) loop in Plain Old Java, I feel a little dirty. Thanks a lot, #Clojure. (via @pmbauer) -- From the "It happens..." department: it happens...</li>
