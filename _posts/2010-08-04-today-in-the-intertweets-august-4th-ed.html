	<li>Clojure for Beginners Course – 2nd Batch Announced (<a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/08/04/clojure-for-beginners-course-2nd-batch-announced/">here</a>, via @L2Program) -- The first (online) course by <a href="rubylearning.org">rubylearning.org</a> was a success, and now there is a new batch coming. The course is $5 that will be donated in full to the Clojure project to fund its development.</li>
	<li>Great Clojure quote from Brenton Ashworth (<a href="http://paul-drummond.tumblr.com/post/902736008/im-now-convinced-that-choosing-a-language-based">here</a>, via @pdrummond) -- That's from a <a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2010/08/03/take-5-brenton-ashworth/">recent interview</a> that @fogus did of Brenton. I am copying the quote here in full: "I’m now convinced that choosing a language based on how easy it is to read or write is a very bad idea. What if we chose musical instruments based on how easy they are to play? Everyone would playing kazoos. You can’t think deeply about music if all you know is a kazoo. Skill at reading and writing code is learned. We should choose languages based on how accurately they allow us to think about the problems we are trying to solve"</li>
