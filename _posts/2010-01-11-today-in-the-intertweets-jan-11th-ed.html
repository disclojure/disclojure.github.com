<ul>
	<li>Yay! The #clojure "master" branch now has deftype, defprotocol etc. And look, there's 1.2 off in the hazy distance... (via @chrishouser) -- So there! If you pull the latest from clojure's master branch at github you'll get the current code for 1.2... no more 1.1. Exciting to see things move this fast!</li>
	<li>How to feed Reddit to Hadoop (<a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.php/2010/01/hadoop-feeding-reddit-to-hadoop/">here</a>, via @LauJensen) -- ... with clojure, of course! All the cool kids now use clojure with hadoop/cascading, and for a reason!, as clojure it makes life much much easier in these environments than, for example, Java. This article shows how to create a job in Clojure.</li>
	<li>Posted the slides from my recent FleetDB talk (<a href="http://bit.ly/8ASDyu ">here</a>, via @mmcgrana) -- FleetDB is a schema-free database build on clojure that has been released very recently, and his author just released the slides of his presentation at the Bay Are Clojure User Group (that I very unfortunately missed because of a bad bug that knocked me and my family out). These slides are fairly self-explanatory, so you should be able to follow them up.</li>
	<li>Clojure.core/str makes sense now (<a href="http://codemeself.blogspot.com/2010/01/clojurecorestr-makes-sense-now.html">here</a>, via @neotyk) -- If you're starting with Clojure, this article is for you. The author, a committer at the <a href="https://grizzly.dev.java.net/">Project Grizzly</a>, is learning Clojure by reading and trying to understand some of clojure's source code. This article explains this process with an example, clojure.core/str.</li>
