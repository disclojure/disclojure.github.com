	<li><a href="http://euroclojure.com/2012/">and we are live! EuroClojure 2012 "the first 2-day, full-blown conference in Europe for the Clojure community."</a> (via @EuroClojure) -- Niiiice! Did you want to go to London but didn't have a valid excuse to do so? Now you have one: Â two days of Clojure talks, with a very interesting <a href="http://euroclojure.com/2012/call-for-presentations/">talk selection method</a>. Now, where can I find a cheap flight?</li>
	<li><a href="http://clojure.com/blog/2012/01/31/first-conj-2011-videos-available.html">First Conj 2011 Videos Available</a> (via @clojure_conj) -- Speaking of Conferences. If you were to slow snagging a ticket for last year's Clojure/conj, you can pretend you did go by watching these very well produced videos of the talks. This is the first batch, more to come.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSM2JFOpZ6g">The first public demo of the @LonoCloud OS implementing a multi-cloud federated mobile health application in #Clojure</a> (via @0x1B) -- Flashy! Doesn't show any Clojure code though...</li>
