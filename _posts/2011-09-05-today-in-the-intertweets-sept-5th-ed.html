	<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/17283" target="_blank">This is handy if you're coming from Ruby to Clojure</a> (via @edham_arief) Mapping of Ruby methods to Clojure functions.

	<li><a href="https://gustavus.edu/+max/concrete-abstractions.html">A Must Read for FP junkies - Concrete Abstractions: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Scheme</a> (via @conikeec) The book is a bit dated, but theÂ explanations of core CS topics are very accesible, with an emphasis on functional programming.</li>
