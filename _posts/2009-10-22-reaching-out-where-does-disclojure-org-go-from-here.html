I read once that it takes 21 days to create a new habit, and I have been posting here for 31 days now, so I guess this is a new habit for me.

When I started this blog I did so in order to be useful to the Clojure community, which today is small, friendly, smart, and it is growing fast. I still intend to be useful and this is the reason for this post.

I am reaching out to you my reader for advice on what would make this site more useful to you and the community. I have thought of a few things:
<ol>
	<li>Create a section for clojure projects. Many projects are springing up that are either built in Clojure or are tools for Clojure</li>
	<li>Write more original articles (I am planning on creating more time for myself to be able to write more about clojure... stay tuned)</li>
	<li>Maybe create some sort of forum? -- there is already an awesome list for clojure, so that would be redundant.</li>
</ol>
What do you think?

If you have any tips that you want to share, please post them in the comments section. I will be giving some more thought to the potential new features in the coming weeks, but I'd love to hear from you.
