  ClojureScript view support rolled into Clutch in 0.4.0-SNAPSHOT

  Good to see ClojureScript being used on the server side. Clutch is a
  library to integrate with [Apache
  CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/), a document database that 
  provides a JavaScript engine to run queries. Clutch historically
  allowed writing queries in Clojure, support but you needed to add a JVM backend to
  CouchDB. Now you can write these queries  in ClojureScript, and have
  them run natively on the JS backend. If you are
  curious, here is how CouchDB views [look
  like](https://github.com/clojure-clutch/clutch#cljsviews).

  Looks as if somebody is taking the pain of translating [On
  Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html) to Clojure. By the way,
  you can get the original book as PDF [for
  free](http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/onlisp.pdf).

  Clojure/Core is opening 3 slots for their fantastic training
  options, but this time you get to vote on what cities these sessions
  will take place. Cast your vote if you want it in your city!
