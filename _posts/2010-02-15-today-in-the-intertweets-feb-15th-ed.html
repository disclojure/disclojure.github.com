<ul>
	<li>Preparing for #Clojure support beyond the #lisp REPL in MCLIDE. (via @MCLIDE) -- it looks like MCLIDE is serious about Clojure :)</li>
	<li>Episode 11 is up - Infinite Sequences (<a href="http://vimeo.com/9460060">here</a>, via @fulldisclojure) -- Sean Devlin introduces the use of infinite sequences in Clojure as a way to abstract infinite computations, and showing how Clojure deals with these infinite sequences possible by deferring the computation of each element in the sequence until it is actually used.</li>
	<li>Google App Engine + Clojure (<a href="http://valvallow.blogspot.com/2010/02/google-app-engine-clojure.html">here</a>, via @valvallow) -- A nice compendium of links to articles and tutorials about writing Google App Engine apps in Clojure.</li>
	<li>#clojure contrib.sql with postgresql and its type mismatch "problem (<a href="http://schipplock.de/2010/02/14/clojure-contrib-sql-timestamp-in-postgresql/">here</a>, via @schipplock) -- If you are planning on using contrib.sql you will find this article interesting. Beyond the issues with Postgres the article shows ways in which you can get around different database quirks.</li>
	<li>#Clojure #cell - new feature is been discussed this very moment on #irc (<a href="http://clojure-log.n01se.net/date/2010-01-22.html#i14">here</a>, via @neotyk) -- Well, not at this moment anymore, but it was discussed nonetheless. "have been working on a model that puts transient use into a new reference type" (Rich Hickey). We shall call it a 'Cell'; only until a better name is found. This is just at inception level, so there will surely be a lot of thinking around this new feature...</li>
	<li>Let Over Reify. (via @fogus) -- Keep going... keep going... you left us all hanging there!</li>
</ul>
