	<li>Seattle people: come talk and write Clojure this Thursday at 7pm (<a href="http://seajure.technomancy.us/">here</a>, via @technomancy)</li>
	<li>Bitcask is one of my favorite open source projects, so I'm anxious to see how this "Bitcask for Clojure" evolves (<a href="http://github.com/hiredman/Amontillado">here</a>, via @mmcgrana) -- This is about Amontillado, a bitcast-inspired storage for Clojure and in Clojure. <a href="http://blog.basho.com/2010/04/27/hello,-bitcask/">Bitcask is a key-value store</a> with very nice operational properties. Work in progress.</li>
	<li>Clojure development with IntelliJ's La Clojure Plugin (<a href="http://gregslepak.posterous.com/clojure-development-with-intellijs-la-clojure">here</a>, via @taoeffect) -- A screen cast showing how to setup IntelliJ IDEA to work with Clojure projectsÂ and a few tricks.</li>
	<li>in case anyone is curious and wants to try clojure for themselves (<a href="http://corfield.org/blog/post.cfm/getting-started-with-clojure">here</a>, via @seancorfield) -- New to Clojure? This is for you.</li>
	<li>Bob Martin announced the arrival of Clojure as the Future of Computing in a concurrent world (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mslMLp5bQD0&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=393ECE649BB3813D&amp;playnext_from=PL&amp;index=9">here</a>, via @IndianGuru) -- A few weeks ago there was a tweet-storm coming from RailsConf 2010 about Bob Martin suggesting everyone to try out Clojure at the keynote speech. Well, here is the video. Worth watching, if anything, for its entertainment value.</li>
	<li>alter-ego - A Reactive AI Library in Clojure (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2010/06/29/alter-ego-a-reactive-ai-library/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29">here</a>, via @xampl) -- This is an implementation of behavior trees. This is used quite commonly in video games to power the brains behind the 'enemies'.</li>
