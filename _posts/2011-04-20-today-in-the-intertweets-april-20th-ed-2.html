	<li>Clojure not without problems! (according to Steve Yegge, plus intrstg discussion) (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/seajure/browse_thread/thread/18baa18ffdbdd790">here</a>, via @mrkkrj) -- Oh my! Not again... Steve Yegge, known for his direct style, announces the future irrelevancy of Clojure if things are not done his way from now on, or something along those lines. Also, it turns out that when he blogs things happen, so things might happen to Clojure soon. Jokes aside, he states that he's got many gripes with clojure, things that he believes need to be addressed for clojure to become mainstream. He says the list of gripes is growing fast and that he is considering posting them all in one blog post. He also mentions that the Clojure community is close minded and opinionated, which shuts down possible collaborators, and he seems very opinionated about this, and not willing to compromise on it either. I do want to see that blog post, since clojure is definitely not without problems. By the way, the discussion continued on <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2466731">Hacker News</a>.</li>
	<li>Nice post from @factual engineer, Aaron: "Thinking in Clojure for Java Programmers (Part 2 — Macros FTW)" (<a href="http://devblog.factual.com/thinking-in-clojure-for-java-programmers-part-2-—-macros-ftw">here</a>, via @eva_ho) -- This is aimed at Java developers and it shows the great deal of flexibility that macros provide to allow you to add new capabilities to the language itself. You can't do that in Java, no no.</li>
	<li>Bearable XML Schema with Clojure (<a href="http://jessehowarth.com/2011/04/14/bearable-xml-schema-with-clojure">here</a>, via @hnfirehose) -- <a href="http://www.github.com/jhowarth/bearable">Bearable</a> is an extension to <a href="http://clojure.github.com/clojure-contrib/prxml-api.html">prxml</a> for generating XML schemas, which is useful if you happen to in that kind of hell.</li>
