Today has been a "let's retweet old stuff" day, or so it seems by the amount of chatter related to old discussions about how Clojure is not cool, but between all that chatter there were some good pearls:
<ul>
	<li>Clojure makes it into CIO magazine in Australia (<a href="http://www.cio.com.au/article/314348/introduction_clojure">here</a>, via @twitt_bot) -- I guess now all our fellow clojurers in AUS can use Cloure in their projects since their CIOs have read about it?</li>
	<li>Clojure functions with meta-data. Image representation #3 (<a href="http://pixel-shaker.fr/en/2009/10/fonction-avec-meta-donnees-clojure-representation-dimages-3/">here</a>, via @fredmn) -- or how to Â allow new types in the meta</li>
	<li>Building a Bifid cipher (<a href="http://reminiscential.wordpress.com/2009/10/20/explore-clojure-building-a-bifid-cipher/">here</a>, via @Reviews2Good) -- title says it all, if you're into code theory and criptography</li>
</ul>
