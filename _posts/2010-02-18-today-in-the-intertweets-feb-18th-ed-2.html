<ul>
	<li>Software Transactional Memory in JRuby using Clojure's infrastructure (<a href="http://developer-in-test.blogspot.com/2010/02/concurrency-software-transactional.html">here</a>, via @sai_venkat) -- a simple (but crude) way to using Clojure's STM inside JRuby.</li>
	<li>Firsts draft of new #Clojure testing framework (<a href="http://paste.lisp.org/display/95188">here</a>, via @stuartsierra)
<ul>
	<li>clojure.test has poor separation between setup/teardown and assertions (via @stuartsierra)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Let me try that again: Don't be a framework. Be a library. In #Clojure we finally have a language which can scale composition. Let's use it. (via @ brentonashworth) -- Word!</li>
</ul>
That's it? Yes. Slow day today. You guys must be having working a lot instead of tweeting!
