	<li>Solving the Expression Problem with Clojure 1.2 (<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-clojure-protocols/index.html">here</a>, via @newseffect9) -- "This article describes the Expression Problem, shows some examples of it, and then demonstrates how Clojure's protocols and datatypes can solve it, which simplifies certain programming challenges.", by Stuart Sierra.</li>
	<li>The only way I could stop maintaining swank-clojure would be to fake death or conversion to vim. Wonder which is harder to do convincingly? (via @technomancy) -- I don't know much about how this Internet thing works, but haven't you just nullified your two options of stop maintaining swank-clojure by tweeting about them?</li>
	<li>Clojure is the fucking way to go. (via @kalkuel) -- Yeah!</li>
	<li>Clojure: everything I dislike about Lisp and the Java ecosystem, wrapped in one neat package! :P (via @warren_s) -- you need to talk to the guy above and trade notes...</li>
