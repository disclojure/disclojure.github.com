Happy New Year!!! Woo hoo!!!

Now, let's get down to business:
<ul>
	<li>Clojure 1.1 released!!! (<a href="http://clojure.blogspot.com/2009/12/clojure-11-release.html">here</a>, via @fogus) -- That was a nice pre-new year's surprise :) You can see what's new in the <a href="http://github.com/richhickey/clojure/blob/1.1.x/changes.txt">release notes</a>, and also Sean Devlin is putting together a <a href="http://vimeo.com/user2842266/videos/sort:date">series of short screencasts</a> explaining in detail the most significant new features. Happy coding everyone!!!</li>
	<li>Scotch, chocolate, and Clojure. (via @abscondment) -- This one really hit some spot with me. I'd say Chivas Regal with 85% dark chocolate and Clojure 1.1... I take suggestions though!</li>
	<li>Solving cryptograms in Clojure (<a href="http://threebrothers.org/brendan/blog/solving-cryptograms-in-clojure/">here</a>, via @abscondment) -- Ah, so Scotch and chocolate (see item right before this one) will bring you to try to solve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram">cryptograms</a> in Clojure using a modified version of <a href="http://norvig.com/sudoku.html">Peter Norvig's Sudoku Solver</a>, by adapting its constraint propagation algorithm. Here is the result: <a href="http://threebrothers.org/files/cryptogram.clj">cryptogram.clj</a> ... I must have not mixed the right amounts of Scotch and chocolate, since my results cannot be posted online ;)</li>
	<li>Proposal for clojure.io from @technomancy (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/23f8b929a8816f63/dc3a05d225c87d7d?show_docid=dc3a05d225c87d7d">here</a>, via @fogus) -- @technomancy proposes moving I/O related stuff from contrib to the clojure namespace itself (clojure.io). The reason being that IO might be one of the top reasons for using contrib in the first place. @stuartsierra indicated that Rich Hickey has already <a href="http://clojure.org/todo">some plans</a> on building a functional, stream-based and thread-safe IO library. The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/23f8b929a8816f63/dc3a05d225c87d7d?show_docid=dc3a05d225c87d7d">original thread</a> is still active, so feel free to provide your insights.</li>
	<li>Griffon clojure 0.4 plugin released, upgraded to Clojure 1.1 (<a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GRIFFON/Clojure+Plugin ">here</a>, via @aalmiray) -- The Clojure plugin enables compiling and running Clojure code on your <a href="http://griffon.codehaus.org/">Griffon</a> application. Griffon is a Grails like application framework (MVC, convention over configuration, etc..)Â for developing desktop applications in Groovy.</li>
	<li>Irresponsibly releasing swank-clojure 1.1.0 (<a href="http://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure">here</a>, via @technomancy) -- If you're using Emacs with SLIME, then you're using swank-clojure... so this is a big deal. Looks like it is mainly about bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
