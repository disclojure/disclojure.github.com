Funny how most of the Clojurers out there get lazy over the weekend --judging by the (small) amount of news:
<ul>
	<li>New Pragmatic Press Book: Seven Languages in Seven Weeks: Ruby, Io, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, Haskell, and Prolog (<a href="http://rapidred.com/blog/seven_languages">here</a>, via @msusies)</li>
	<li>Mark Volkmann's slides of his talk at Strange Loop "Tackling Concurrency with STM" (<a href="http://java.ociweb.com/mark/stm/">here</a>, via @mark_volkmann) -- if you haven't already done so, check out his excellent (and long) <a href="http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html">article on Clojure</a></li>
</ul>
