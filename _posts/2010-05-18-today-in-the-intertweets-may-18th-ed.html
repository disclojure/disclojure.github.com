You might have noticed I haven't posted in a few days. It turns out that in some hotels in Spain, when they offer internet, they mean you can use the phone to dial-up your ISP... and for that you need a modem. A modem. In 2010. Oh well.

Here are the relevant tweets of the day:
<ul>
	<li>Clojure in the field (<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Clojure-in-the-Field">here</a>, via @spariev) -- The presentation that @stuarthalloway gave at the last QCon is now online at infoq.com (video and slides). It's an intro to Clojure with some real-life experiences.</li>

	<li>A different take on mocking in #clojure (<a href="http://hugoduncan.org/post/2010/mocking_clojure_functions_with_atticus.xhtml">here</a>, via @hugoduncan) -- With this article Hugo Duncan introduces his mocking framework <a href="http://github.com/hugoduncan/atticus">atticus</a> which in some ways is more idiomatic that the existing mocking frameworks for clojure.
