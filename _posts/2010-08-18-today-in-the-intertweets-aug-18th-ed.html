<ul>
	<li>Conj Labs goes to Frankfurt 26-28/10! Learn #clojure with @LauJensen and me (<a href="http://www.conj-labs.eu/">here</a>, via @cgrand) -- In Europe? You can also lean from the pros.</li>
	<li>Learning to switch from (a) common #lisp to idiomatic #clojure (<a href="http://edgargoncalves.posterous.com/learning-to-switch-from-a-common-lisp-to-idio">here</a>, via @edgargoncalves) -- This is a good article to show to a lisper that wonders what people mean when they talk about "idiomatic clojure".It walks the reader through the process of transforming a very Common-lispy function to a more idiomatic Clojure one.</li>
	<li>Why Clojure? (<a href="http://thecleancoder.blogspot.com/2010/08/why-clojure.html">here</a>, via @unclebobmartin) -- Bob Martin has been touting Clojure for a while, sometime very publicly like in the last RailsConf keynote. In this article he explains his reasons for choosing Clojure, both over imperative languages and over other functional languages. Bob has been doing an excellent job and convincing large numbers of developers to give a try to Functional Programming in general and Clojure in particular. (I registered more than 200 retweets for his tweet, for example.)</li>
	<li>Micro languages in Clojure - part 2 (<a href="http://will.groppe.us/post/973148216/micro-languages-in-clojure-part-2">here</a>, via @wilig) -- More on writing DSLs in Clojure. In the previous article the author introduced to a full DSL for generating SQL queries. This new installment covers some new features for this DSL: variable binding and nesting of expressions.</li>
	<li>Arkham, a clojure interpreter (<a href="http://github.com/hiredman/Arkham">here</a>, via @hiredman_) -- "lisp interpreter with clojure like semantics". Funny how instead of 'eval', you have 'evil' :)</li>
