<ul>
	<li>#StackOverflow just fielded its 1000th #Clojure question. Way to go! (via @missingfaktor)</li>
	<li>Functional Programming with Clojure: Simple Concurrency on the JVM (<a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/refcardz/functional-programming-clojure">here</a>, via @mamersfo) -- A refcard for clojure, published by <a href="http://refcardz.dzone.com/">dzone</a>.</li>
	<li>Starting a Cluster on EC2 with Pallet (<a href="http://twoguysarguing.wordpress.com/2010/11/01/starting-a-cluster-on-ec2-with-pallet">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- A nice introduction to deploying applications on the cloud with <a href="http://hugoduncan.github.com/pallet/">pallet</a>, a clojure library that lets you manage your applications in the cloud from the REPL (or lein, or cake)</li>
	<li>Starting on my Clojure Conj 2011 topic... "The Macronomicon" :-) (<a href="http://github.com/fogus/macronomicon">here</a>, via @fogus) -- A book on how to substitute macros for functions in clojure code. It is very well needed, judging for the flak that the excessive use of macros got at clojure-conj. Very WIP.</li>
	<li>Posted about async support in Ring (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ring-clojure/browse_thread/thread/243f452c915356c8">here</a>, via @mmcgrana) -- Mark McGranaghan decided to review the <a href="http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring">Ring</a> <a href="http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring/blob/master/SPEC">SPEC</a> to add support for asynchronous operations, which would help web servers handle large numbers of connected clients without exhausting the server's resources, amongst other goodies. <a href="http://gist.github.com/657694">Here</a> is an example app with sync, long-poll, streaming, and websockets. Read the proposal and chime in!</li>
	<li>@technomancy &amp; @ninjudd are collaborating on the project.clj spec as we speak, now if only I could track down the PMaven/ #clojure guys :) (via @LauJensen) -- Ooohh! one project.clj to rule them all!
<ul>
	<li>Thanks to man behind the curtain @cemerick, the Maven crew is now engaged in designing the spec as well! One format to rule them all awaits! (via @LauJensen) -- ...and then there were three... :)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Tech Talk at LinkedIn: "Clojure at BackType" (including live demo) (here, via @backtypetech) -- Watch Nathan Marz showcase <a href="http://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog">Cascalog</a>, a datalog-inspired data processing engine for Hadoop.</li>
