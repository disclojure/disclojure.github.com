Hey, I know you guys didn't know what to do over the weekends since there were no postings on disclojure. Well, that situation is no more!

On Saturdays I will post about what happened a year ago in the Clojure universe. This way we'll see how far we've all moved in just one year :)

Below is the first post of this series

Enjoy,

Toni.

So what happened on the week of Sept 23rd 2009?
<ul>
	<li>I got the <a href="http://twitter.com/amitrathore/statuses/4138092465">first evidence</a> of a book named "Clojure in Action" being in the works. Now you can buy an early access version of it <a href="http://www.manning.com/rathore/">here</a>.</li>
