  For all Scala and Clojure fans. It's nice to see the other side of
  the coin sometimes. But I still enjoy FP

  Now this is one rant! Not everybody thinks that statelessness is a
  worthy goal. Some even think that striving for immutablility is
  evil. But some go even further and rant about how they
  think Functional Programming is "worse than crap."

  #Clojure Library to do #integration test with Social Networks -

  If you are writing an application that interacts with a social network you
  probably already know how hard it can be to test against the
  services provided by such social network. This library aids at
  creating automated integration tests against social networks.

  New post! Starting a new project: A Java bytecode compiler in Clojure.

  This is not a library to generate Java bytecode. Instead, this turns
  bytecode into machine code for direct execution by the CPU.
  [Crawl](https://github.com/jduey/crawl/) is a 
  Clojure re-implementation of [OpenJDK's
  Graal](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/graal/).

  #Clojure persistent queues getting a tagged literal representation
 author: fogus
 url: https://github.com/fogus/clojure/tree/queue-literal
 comment: >
  Leveraging the new extensible reader literals in Clojure 1.4,
  Michael Fogus is implementing a reader literal for persistent
  queues. Check out [the
  tests](https://github.com/fogus/clojure/commit/ce74a12c2584642e3a5e0f9bb3b4940e060df542#L2R513)
  to figure out how it will look.
