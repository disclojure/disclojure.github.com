Happy Thanksgiving day for all who live in the US!
<ul>
	<li> Scalable scraping in Clojure (<a href="http://lethain.com/entry/2009/nov/24/scalable-scraping-in-clojure/">here</a>, via @antest) -- A tutorial that builds a tool to monitor craigslist to find relevant posts and store them to disk. The interesting part is the architecture of the final application, which is quite scalable!</li>
	<li>Emacs, Clojure and Windows (<a href="http://tommih.blogspot.com/2009/08/emacs-clojure-and-windows.html">here</a>, via @jneira) -- If you *have* to develop Clojure on Windows and want to use Emacs, this is your article</li>
	<li>Generating Clojure import lines using SLIME (<a href="http://dishevelled.net/Generating-Clojure-import-lines-using-SLIME.html">here</a>, via @jneira) -- this is an awesome hack. As the author says: "Pretty gross! But then who of us isn't?" ... well, it's not that gross! And it gets Emacs a tad closer to IntelliJ+LaClojure or Netbeans+Enclojure...</li>
	<li>Summary of Clojure usage survey (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/df61abf2aca68985">here</a>, via @stuartsierra) --  69% of you get their clojure from GitHub? Geeks!</li>
	<li>Start of continuation-based library on top of #compojure in #clojure (<a href="http://intensivesystems.net/tutorials/web_sessions.html">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- or how you don't need to do OO to have modular code... This article is about adding comprehensive session handling to Compojure in a clean way</li>
	<li>Concur.next — More Clojure I/O (<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/11/25/Clojure-grinding">here</a>, via @timbray) -- Yet another article in Tim Bray's series exploring Clojure. This time he incorporates some of the suggestions found in the comments to his previous articles, adding map-reduce and agents to his wide-finder code. He is not conclusive on the relative performance of Clojure vs. other languages, but states the following: "I wondered how much of that 70 minutes might be a Clojure tax, so I wrote a Java version, as close to identical as I could manage, and it took... about 68 minutes. Good for Clojure."</li>
