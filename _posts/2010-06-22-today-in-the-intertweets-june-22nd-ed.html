<ul>
	<li>From the looks of it the first #Clojure meetup in Sweden had more participants than *all* #Lisp meetups in Sweden. Ever! ;-) (via @rplaca)</li>
	<li>atticus now has a macro for defining #clojure defrecord instance factories for use in testing (<a href="http://hugoduncan.github.com/atticus/atticus.factory-api.html">here</a>, via @hugoduncan) -- <a href="http://github.com/hugoduncan/atticus">Atticus</a> is a novel mocking framework from Hugo Duncan.</li>
	<li>Finite State Machine Implementation in Clojure (<a href="http://nakkaya.com/2010/06/22/finite-state-machine-implementation-in-clojure/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- Another very approachable article from Nurullah Akkaya.</li>
	<li>"You're all sitting on the end of the food chain, eating gazelles and saying, 'who needs photosynthesis to be easy'?" (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/6ac537c2aa518757?hl=en">here</a>, via @stilkov) -- This is in reference to the effort to have Clojure efficiently work with primitive types without the need to promoting them into objects. The goal, raw speed. In this post to the Clojure list, Rich Hickey why efficient use of primitive types in Clojure is so important, even if it comes with some inconveniences.</li>
	<li>Ask HN: Who's using Clojure, and to do what? (<a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1453259">here</a>, via @HNTweets) -- Interesting read. Pay attention to the complaining about how difficult/slow it is to submit patches to Clojure and Clojure/contrib</li>
