<ul>
	<li>Clojure - good coding guidelines (<a href="http://techbehindtech.com/2010/12/09/clojure-good-coding-guidelines/">here</a>, via @sivajag) -- These are not all the guidelines, but it is a good place to start if you're new to Clojure. As a bonus, if you leave that page open for a while you might be induced to think that your coffee was either too strong or that somebody laced it with some hallucinogen.</li>
	<li>Clojure 1.3 Alpha 4 (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/59a22dcbc6be628f?pli=1">here</a>, via @stuarthalloway) -- Now with global unchecked math support....</li>
	<li>I'm running Wordpress in Clojure! (via @pepijndevos) -- Whaaa?!?!? <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/pepijndevos/status/13631335688044544">Oh</a>. Run Clojure inside FastCGI, along with other popular web languages.</li>
	<li>How-To - IntelliJ Idea for Clojure/Compojure on Google App Engine (<a href="http://blog.kartikshah.info/2010/12/how-to-intellij-idea-for.html">here</a>, via @lucastex_grails) -- A short and sweet article on how to write a simple web app in clojure deployable to Google App Engine, all using IntelliJ IDEA and La Clojure plugin.</li>
	<li>A clojure introduction in swedish. (<a href="http://vimeo.com/15711147">here</a>, via @mikaelsundberg) -- No comment; my Swedish knowledge is nil.</li>
	<li>My experiences consuming the crunchbase api with clojure (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ossareh/status/14079140298760193">here</a>, via @ossareh) -- Clojure resource management is sometimes hard because of clojure's laziness. It is fairly easy to write programs in Clojure that force the runtime to keep large datastructures around, even when you think they've already been garbage collected. This article is a good warning for all you guys new (and not so new) to clojure.</li>
