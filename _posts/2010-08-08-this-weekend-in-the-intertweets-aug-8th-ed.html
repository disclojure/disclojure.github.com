<ul>
	<li>Good Clojure news site (<a href="http://coder.io/tag/clojure">here</a>, via @tim_coder) -- yet another way of getting your news about Clojure. This link summarizes the links posted on twitter under the #clojure tag.</li>
	<li>#Cake (#Clojure #Rake) looks great, solves local dependencies problem, but it doesn't work on windows (<a href="http://github.com/ninjudd/cake">here</a>, via @qertoip) -- Cake is a <a href="http://docs.rubyrake.org/tutorial/index.html">rake</a>-inspired build tool for Clojure that is compatible also with leiningen projects. It makes it very easy to define your own tasks, extend existing ones and parse command-line parameters. It also provides a persistent JVM so you can run command after command without the need to fire-up a new JVM (and wait for it to start).</li>
	<li>Micro-interview about Clojure, Scala, and ill-will. MartinOdersky take(5) toList (<a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2010/08/06/martinodersky-take5-tolist/">here</a>, via @fogus) -- Martin says Scala and Clojure are <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bff">BFF</a></li>
	<li>"Measure your OODA loop in all the languages you know. See which one cycles fastest...that's your favorite language." (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop">here</a>, via @sfioritto) -- OODA stands for Observe, Orient, Decide and Act and in this context it refers to the time it takes from realizing that your program has a bug to the time it takes to find it and fixit. The article makes reference to how Lisp on a Symbolics machine would have an extremely short OODA, and thus it was very productive.</li>
	<li>Writing a Parser (for a markup language): Theory &amp; Practice (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3427810/writing-a-parser-for-a-markup-language-theory-practice">here</a>, via planetclojure) -- This is a question on Stack Overflow about the existing tools to write a parser in Clojure. All the answers are pretty interesting.</li>
	<li>#clojure 1.2 RC2 is out (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/1a2dfc612d2e0c88">here</a>, via @stuarthalloway) -- This is some speedy development!</li>
	<li>Some usefull information about Clojure servers (<a href="http://www.xcombinator.com/2010/07/30/a-simple-netty-http-server-in-clojure/">here</a>, via @pepijndevos) -- The different options today to write an evented HTTP server in Clojure.</li>
	<li>Exploring Riak with Clojure (<a href="http://mmcgrana.github.com/2010/08/riak-clojure.html">here</a>, via @mmcgrana) -- <a href="http://www.basho.com/Riak.html">Riak</a> is a powerful distributed datastore built by <a href="http://www.basho.com/">Basho</a>. It can scale massively while keeping some good properties. This tutorial walks you through the steps to write a simple application that uses Riak for storage.</li>
