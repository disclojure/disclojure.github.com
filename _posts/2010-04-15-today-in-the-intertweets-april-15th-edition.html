Tax day in the US, so I am assuming the drop in the number of tweets has to do with this event :(
<ul>
	<li>Didn't know there was a Bangalore Clojure Users group: but only 27 members? That few Clojure developers in Bangalore? (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/bangalore-clj">here</a>, via @sids) -- Maybe now you'll get more people to sign up?</li>
	<li>20+ Clojurians to Follow on Twitter Â (<a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/04/15/20-clojurians-to-follow-on-twitter/">here</a>, via @IndianGuru) -- Satish Talim and Michael Kohl, the brain behind the upcoming free <a href="http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/03/09/clojure-101-a-new-course/">Clojure 101</a> training have compiled a list of clojurians you can (should) follow on twitter.</li>
	<li>"Clojure is so close to Lisp and Scheme that it is better to join it with other Lisp like languages." ha-ha #fail (<a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">here</a>, via @cemerick) -- Really? Clojure is as popular as CL and Scheme? The guys who put together the TIPBE Programming Community Index seem to think so. Ah, and C surpassed Java (!)</li>
	<li>Rich Hickey thinks Clojure 1.2 is near! (via @clojure) -- Folks, I really don't know what to say about this tweet. @clojure is not Rich Hickey as far as I know. Also there is no link to any email/chat log that provides any evidence of this... So I don't know how credible this tweet is :( . Any hints? EDIT: @laujensen actually confirmed that I am totally wrong on this and that indeed Rich Hickey said in IRC that Clojure 1.2 is near... my bad!</li>
	<li>lein bash completion (<a href="http://gist.github.com/367421">here</a>, via @timcharper) -- If you're on Un*x and using bash, this addition to your completion script will provide you with completion for leiningen at the command line.</li>
	<li>my #oredev intro to #clojure is finally online (<a href="http://oredev.org/videos/clojure">here</a>, via @stuarthalloway)-- There is another presentation from the same event that was already online <a href="http://www.oredev.org/prod/oredev/site.nsf/docsbycodename/session?opendocument&amp;sid=A63BC77001A119BFC12575D5003BC000&amp;track=2556B90C592E1E23C12575A500499CC6&amp;day=5">here</a> (Concurrent Programming in Clojure)</li>
</ul>
