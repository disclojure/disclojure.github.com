  Clojure vs. Scala

 tweet: Added records, tagged literals and syntax quote / unquote to
  clojure-reader. Only fn literals and eval reader left.

 comment: This is about a clojure-reader implemented in clojure.
  Another step for Clojure in Clojure?

 tweet: Clojure vs Scala

 comment: > An interesting way to compare two languages, a survey that 
  feels almost like one of those psychology tests... As a summary of,
  it seems that people seem to like clojure more than they like Scala,
  but they also find Scala to be more likely to be used at work in the
  future.

When last year Rich Hickey said that he would be talking about "something new"
at the NYC Clojure Users Group meetup, disclojure ran a fun poll about what
people thought the 'new thing' would be. 

Last week [Clojure/West](http://clojurewest.org) ([register
now](http://www.regonline.com/clojurewest2012)) tweeted the following
["Rich Hickey swore me to secrecy today about what he's been working
on and will discuss at Clojure/West. It's
big."](https://twitter.com/#!/ClojureWest/status/167788290454466560).
This means it's time for another poll. 

Please send your proposed options for the poll today!
(Either by tweeting the option cc/@disclojure, or in the comments
section in this post)
