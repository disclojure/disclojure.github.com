	<li>"Thinking #clojure needs its own Maven repository." (<a href="http://twitter.com/stuartsierra/statuses/4472134212">link</a>)Â This post by @stuartsierra seems to have started a chain of -- hopefully eventful -- events. Although the opinions on Maven are always divided (can't we all get along?) IMHO having all clojure needed jars in a Maven repository would be a good thing for all, even if you don't use Maven and use something else like ivy. CPAN style.
