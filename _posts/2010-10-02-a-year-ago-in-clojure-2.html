	<li>Lau Jensen posted two fun articles, one about <a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.clj/2009/09/chaos-theory-vs-clojure.html">Ikeda maps</a>, and the other about a <a href="http://www.bestinclass.dk/index.clj/2009/10/brians-functional-brain.html">functional (and parallel) implementation of Brians' brain</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://clojuratica.weebly.com/">Clojuratica</a> v0.9, an interface between Clojure and Mathematica, was released.</li>
	<li>@stuartsierra said "Thinking #clojure needs its own Maven repository." To which I commented "Although the opinions on Maven are always divided (can’t we all get along?)...". Maven is still controversial today :(</li>
	<li>"It seems confirmed that there is a clojure book coming from Manning and by Amit Rathore".<a href="http://www.manning.com/rathore/"> Turns out the rumors were true!</a> :)</li>
	<li><a href="http://cemerick.com/2009/10/01/java-is-dead-but-youll-learn-to-love-it/">Java is dead, but you’ll learn to love it, from</a> @cemerick -- And that was *before* Sun got bought out by Oracle. Still very relevant today.</li>
