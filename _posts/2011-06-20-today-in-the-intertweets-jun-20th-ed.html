	<li>Announcing Unk: A pluggable, manipulable, inspectable, and extendable memoization library for #Clojure (<a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2011/06/20/unk/">here</a>, via @fogus) -- Clojure's <a href="http://clojure.github.com/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/memoize">memoize</a> is very useful in some straightforward cases, but in production scenarios sometimes you need more control on what and for how long things are memoized. This library provides this flexibility while being a drop-in replacement for memoize. The listed algorithms also have had a long history and many authors.</li>
