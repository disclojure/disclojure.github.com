	<li>Check out <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/neotyk/status/101322417665884160">#ClojureScript talking to #Clojure over #WebSocket</a> (via @neotyk) -- It's a web chat application.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/samaaron/at-at">Ahead-of-time function scheduler for Clojure</a> (via @maclausen) -- This is a library extracted from Overtone that let's you schedule the calling of a function for some time in the future. A nice way to freak yourself if you have a memory like mine (The computer is alive! It's calling functions on it's own!)</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/fmw/vix">Document Repository written in Clojure</a> (via @maclausen) -- Well, clojure and clojurescript. This is a product that's been opensourced and that will have also a commercial offering.</li>
	<li>#Heroku supporting #Clojure: "<a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/08/heroku_polyglot">It was also a natural choice because we use and love Clojure for ourselves</a>" (via @jmeydam) -- An infoQ article about Heroku's multi-language support in which, amongst other things, quotes one of the founders of Heroku talking about why they support clojure.</li>
	<li><a href="http://arcanesentiment.blogspot.com/2011/08/why-use-keywords-as-symbols.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+ArcaneSentiment+%28Arcane+Sentiment%29">Why use keywords as symbols (in #lisp)</a>? (via @jneira) -- Interesting article about why do keywords exist in Lisp when symbols would be enough, but also provides some insight on why do people actually use them.</li>
	<li><a href="http://travis-ci.org/#!/michaelklishin/langohr/builds/76284">First successful</a> #clojure build on <a href="http://travis-ci.org">travis-ci.org</a> by our own @michaelklishin, <a href="https://github.com/michaelklishin/langohr/blob/master/.travis.yml">how to set up</a> (via @travisci) -- Travis is a Ruby-based Continous Integration server for Open Source projects. Looks like making it build a clojure project is simple enough.</li>
</ul>
NOTE: By overwhelming popular request (well, a suggestion by a single individual...) I am trying a new way of linking referred articles/pages in each tweet report, following a <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere">W3C recommendation</a>. This change shouldÂ let clojurians suffering of <a href="http://www.musophobia.com/">musophobia</a> easily click on the links (i.e. they browse with the keyboard, not the rodent). Not sure sure I can fully follow these recommendations since they seem geared towards calls to action, which most tweets are not, but I'll try for a while and see how it goes, or better, you tell me how it goes!

Keep the suggestions coming!
