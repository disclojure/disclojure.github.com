	<li>Blogged about my first Clojure on Windows encounter (<a href="http://kjeldahl.net/d7/clojure-clr-first-encounter">here</a>, via @kjeldahl) -- The article describes the steps to get cljojure-clr working on a windows environment and then tries to write some GUI code with it. Windows makes it somewhat harder to do so at the repl, at least compared to Java/Swing; some key objects can only be instantiated once per application's lifetime, which means only once per clojure session.</li>
	<li>Un RPG hecho en Clojure (<a href="http://resatori.com/cyber-dungeon-quest-alpha-1">here</a>, via @genezeta) -- An RPG game written in clojure (and playable via Java Web Start). This has been in the works for quite a while and it still needs more work, but with this post the author releases a playable build.</li>
	<li>On the proccess of writing a game engine in Clojure (<a href="http://pepijndevos.nl/on-the-proccess-of-writing-a-game-engine-in-c">here</a>, via @pepijndevos) -- Speaking of games, here is an account of the design process followed while trying to produce a game in clojure. It lists the different designs that the game went through.</li>
	<li>great blog post on #clojure command line args by @jakemcc (here, via @gar3thjon3s) -- Great indeed. This article describes in detail two different ways to deal with command line parameters: <a href="http://clojure.github.com/clojure-contrib/command-line-api.html">c.c.command-line</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gar3thjon3s/clargon">clargon</a>.</li>
