<ul>
	<li>Aleph, an asynchronous web server, written in Clojure (<a href="http://github.com/ztellman/aleph">here</a>, via @stilkov) -- Zach Tellman just announced an asynchronous web server built on top of <a href="http://www.jboss.org/netty">Netty</a> and it mostly conforms to <a href="http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring">Ring's</a> interface. This server uses NIO for managing network communications, and also decouples threads from requests, which is important to scale.
<ul>
	<li>Someone is already having good result with aleph (#clojure+netty). beating node.js in hello world is no small feat. (<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/377b8450120a23dd">here</a>, via @wmacgyver) -- Nice! Throughput increased 7x over Jetty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Added Roger Bodamer on Scaling MongoDB and Chris Houser talking about Clojure and the expression problem (<a href="http://strangeloop2010.com/speakers">here</a>, via @strangeloop_stl) -- Nice, 2 talks about clojure already (the other one being by @marick)</li>
	<li>On Lisp's (clojure) Readability and Parenthesis Stacking (<a href="http://gregslepak.posterous.com/on-lisps-readability">here</a>, via @jneira) -- An article proposing that trailing parenthesis is better than stacking them. (Added for completeness, but...are we seriously discussing indentation styles?)</li>
	<li>High Level Testing with a High Level Language (<a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2010/07/high-level-testing-with-high-level.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+clojure+%28Planet+Clojure%29&amp;utm_content=Twitter">here</a>, via @planetclojure) -- A summary of a year and a half of using Clojure to test Java code. Worth reading because it shows where the impedance can be found when trying to get a Java team to use functional languages.</li>
	<li>New blogpost/screencast: Trail blazing innovators - Use Emacs! (<a href="http://bestinclass.dk/index.clj/2010/07/trail-blazing-innovators.html">here</a>, via @LauJensen) -- This post tries to explain why some developers chose Emacs as an IDE. Good tips on Clojure debugging :)</li>
</ul>
