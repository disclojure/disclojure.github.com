The clojure twitterati have been busy the last two days discussing how to make it easy for developers approaching clojure to start developing quickly. The tendency of many clojurians to use and promote Emacs+Slime is seen as a potential deterrent for newbies to feel comfortable with Clojure. It does look like the community needs to make a bigger effort in promoting IDEs that are closer to what current non-lisp developers use (i.e. Netbeans, IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc...).

In parallel, a similar discussion started in regards to build tools. Maven vs. Leiningen, which one is easier/better...

But that is not all, here are the rest of the tweets:
