<ul>
	<li>Some reactions to Tim Bray's "<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/12/01/Clojure-Theses">11 theses on Clojure</a>":
<ul>
	<li>About Clojure/Lisp readibility  (<a href="http://www.innoq.com/blog/st/2009/12/clojurelisp_readability.html">here</a>, via @stilkov) -- I still don't understand what the fuzz is about Lisps being hard to read... this article just shows how weak this argument against Lisp is. Don't miss Rich Hikey's comment.</li>
	<li>About "Clojure being a Lisp is a Handicap" (<a href="http://tiago.org/cc/2009/12/02/clojure-being-a-lisp-is-a-handicap/">here</a>, via @tiagoantao) -- same topic as the previous article. This time discussing weirdness of prefix notation... I say: It's worse in Latin, where the verb comes last!</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Component Based Software Architecture Using Clojure (<a href="http://dublindan.posterous.com/component-software">here</a>, via @antest) -- "Just for fun, I implemented a simple system for constructing a component based software architecture where each component runs completely independently and asynchronously. Components communicate by sending events to each other, achieving a flat software hierarchy." Neat!</li>
	<li>Scheme interpreter in #Clojure, very useful (<a href="http://clojure.wikidot.com/scheme-interpreter-in-clojure">here</a>, via @zef)</li>
	<li>Why I chose Common Lisp over Python, Ruby, and Clojure (<a href="http://postabon.posterous.com/why-i-chose-common-lisp-over-python-ruby-and">here</a>, via @antest) -- I don't know what to say... other than: the author would have probably chosen Clojure if he had to make the decision today. This article is more relevant in comparing Lisp to Python and Ruby, but when it comes to comparing Clojure to Common Lisp it doesn't say much...</li>
</ul>
