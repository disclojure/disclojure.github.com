<ul>
	<li><a href="http://jlongster.com/2012/01/16/outlet-gets-a-personality.html">outlet a new lisp like language compiles to js, inspired by scheme and #clojure</a> (via @wmacgyver) -- It's borrowing the data structure literals from Clojure, amongst other things. WIP. Worth checking it out.</li>
	<li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/2f87bc0edcdd4e16">Jars for ClojureScript on Maven Central!??!?! Nice way to start the weekend, no? </a>(via @disclojure) -- Oh yeah. That is a gigantic step for all those developing applications using ClojureScript. This makes the building process saner (did I just put 'sane' and 'build process' in the same sentence?!)</li>
	<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/1653728">A #clojure macro I wrote recently can be expressed much more elegantly as a clojure monad</a> (via @sritchie09) -- A nice example of the usefulness of Monads.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTwnoZEw7FE&amp;feature=youtu.be">A roughly three-hour screencast of me building http://typkov.stevelosh.com with Clojure/Noir/Vim</a> (via @stevelosh) -- Needless to say, I watched the whole movie! I think we're a tad far from the "Build a website in 5 minutes" demos that the Rails guys used to do...</li>
