 tweet: Clojure/huh? - Clojure's Governance and How It Got That Way
 url: http://clojure.com/blog/2012/02/17/clojure-governance.html
 author: craigandera
 comment: >
   Clojure/Core explains its own view on why  things move very slowly 
   in Clojure. I'll just reuse the article's final paragraph: _"[...] no one
   in the Clojure community owes anybody anything. If you want something,
   it's not enough to ask for it, you need to be willing to do the work to
   make it happen. At the same time, don't let a lukewarm response to ideas 
   on the mailing list dissuade you from implementing something you think 
   is valuable. It might just be that no one has time to think about it. 
   Recall keyword arguments: more than two years from inception to completion 
   [...]"_

 tweet: Got a start on a JRuby ext to wrap Clojure stuffs...
 url: https://github.com/headius/clojr/blob/master/src/main/ruby/example.rb
 author: headius
 comment: Charles Nutter (headius) is the guy behind JRuby and a JVM
   wizz, and now he seems to be working on wrapping clojure data
   structures in JRuby. I thought they already came wrapped, in
   parantheses!?

 tweet: > The Clojure/West Friend of Attendee program has doubled down -
  get $50 discount or a $50 refund! 
 author: ClojureWest

 comment: > If you missed the early pricing, this is a nice way to get a
   discount. You can reference a friend and get a $50 discount! Don't
   have a friend? Reference me!

 tweet: High-wage skills on oDesk (or why you might want to learn
   Clojure if you're not a lawyer)

 comment: > Oh, good, because I suck at law... This article is a study
   of the many contracting offers offered at
   [oDesk](http://odesk.com), an eBay for contractors, so to speak. It
   turns out that knowing Clojure pays.

 tweet: An invitation to functional programming for Clojure noobs
 author: drcabana

  http://drcabana.org/2012/02/18/an-invitation-to-fp-for-clojure-noobs/
 comment: > 
   This is an interesting deal for FP noobs: a project to solve
   31 [project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems, one for each day of the month (and
   maybe an extra one, or 3, for the shorter months). Based on
   leiningen and marginalia, in which new concepts and clojure
   functions are progressivel introduced with links to
   [clojuredocs](http://clojuredocs.org).

 tweet: > #Clojure #ClojureScript all of you who have been waiting for a
   CLJS example, here you go
 author: ibdknox
 url:
  http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/02/20/overtone-and-clojurescript/
 comment: > Now this is a nice combination of names: Clojure,
  ClojureScript and Overtone. This post shows --both with video and
  in the content of the article itself-- how to build a web-based
  music controller to drive Overtone. The video is only 24 minutes
  short! This is a perfect acticle if you want to see how developing
  in Clojure+ClojureScript is shaping up these days.
